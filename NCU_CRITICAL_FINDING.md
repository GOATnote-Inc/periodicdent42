# 🔬 NCU Critical Finding: Low Occupancy Bottleneck

**Date**: Oct 17, 2025  
**Kernel**: `fmha_cutlassF_f16_aligned_64x64_rf_sm80` (xFormers CUTLASS FMHA)  
**Champion Latency**: 33.19 μs on L4

---

## **🚨 SMOKING GUN: LOW OCCUPANCY**

### **NCU Metrics**

```
Theoretical Occupancy:  33.33%  ← Limited by REGISTERS
Achieved Occupancy:      9.28%  ← ACTUAL (3.6× worse!)
Active Warps per SM:     4.46   ← Out of 48 possible (9.3%)
Eligible Warps:          0.27   ← Out of 12 per scheduler
Issue Slot Utilization: 25.74%  ← Hardware IDLE 74% of time!
```

### **Occupancy Limits**

```
Block Limit (SM):          24 blocks  ← Hardware max
Block Limit (Registers):    4 blocks  ← ⚠️ BOTTLENECK!
Block Limit (Shared Mem):   5 blocks  ← Also constrained
Block Limit (Warps):       12 blocks  ← OK
```

**Root Cause**: **REGISTER PRESSURE** limits occupancy to 4 blocks per SM

---

## **📊 What This Means**

### **1. Latency-Bound Due to Low Occupancy**

**Problem**:
- Only 4.46 active warps per SM (out of 48 possible!)
- Only 0.27 eligible warps per cycle
- **74% of cycles have NO instruction issued**

**Why It Hurts**:
- Instructions have latency (e.g., memory loads: ~400 cycles)
- Normally, other warps run while one waits
- **But with only 4.46 warps, there aren't enough to hide latency!**

**Result**: SM sits IDLE waiting for slow instructions to complete

---

### **2. NCU's Explanation**

> **"Every cycle with no eligible warp results in no instruction being issued  
> and the issue slot remains unused. To increase the number of eligible warps,  
> reduce the time the active warps are stalled by inspecting the top stall reasons."**

**Translation**:
- Hardware can run 48 warps per SM
- Kernel only launches 4.46 warps per SM
- Not enough warps → can't hide latency → SM idles

---

### **3. Why Low Occupancy?**

**Register Pressure**:
- Each thread uses **many registers** (for Tensor Core GEMM logic)
- L4 has 65,536 registers per SM
- With high register usage → can only fit 4 blocks per SM
- This limits warps to: 4 blocks × 4 warps/block = **16 theoretical warps**
- But achieved is only **4.46 warps** (workload imbalance)

**Shared Memory**:
- Also constrained (5 blocks limit)
- 64x64 tiles need significant SMEM

---

## **🎯 Optimization Implications**

### **What Would Help** (Occupancy optimizations)

1. **Reduce registers per thread** ⏱️ 40-60 hours, 10-30% gain
   - Spill to local memory (slower but more warps)
   - Reduce intermediate values
   - **Risk**: May hurt performance if spills are expensive

2. **Reduce shared memory per block** ⏱️ 20-40 hours, 5-15% gain
   - Smaller tile sizes (e.g., 32x32 instead of 64x64)
   - **Risk**: More iterations, less compute intensity

3. **Tune block/warp configuration** ⏱️ 10-20 hours, 5-10% gain
   - Try different block sizes
   - EvoEngineer-style sweep
   - **Risk**: May not fit Tensor Core requirements

---

### **What Won't Help**

- ❌ Vectorization (not memory-bound)
- ❌ Coalescing (DRAM only 8.9%)
- ❌ L2 cache (already low utilization)
- ❌ More Tensor Cores (already using them, just idle)

## **🏆 Why xFormers is Hard to Beat**

### **CUTLASS Engineers Already Optimized This!**

The xFormers team (and CUTLASS library) **already know** about this tradeoff:

**They chose**:
- High register usage (complex Tensor Core logic)
- Lower occupancy (33% theoretical, 9% achieved)
- **But**: Each warp does MORE work (Tensor Cores are fast!)

**Alternative** (naïve approach):
- Low register usage → higher occupancy
- **But**: Each warp does LESS work (no Tensor Cores, slower ALU)

**Result**: xFormers' approach is **FASTER** despite low occupancy!

---

### **The Math**

```
Option 1 (xFormers):
  Occupancy: 9.3%
  Work per warp: HIGH (Tensor Cores, 32× FMA throughput)
  Latency: 33.19 μs ✅

Option 2 (High occupancy):
  Occupancy: 80%
  Work per warp: LOW (scalar ALU)
  Latency: ~500 μs (estimated, slower!) ❌
```

**Lesson**: **Quality > Quantity** (smart warps > many warps)

---

## **📈 Can We Beat It?**

### **Option A: Accept xFormers (RECOMMENDED)**

**Rationale**:
- xFormers engineers are **experts** (NVIDIA, Meta)
- They've already tuned this tradeoff
- 33.19 μs is **excellent** for L4
- NCU confirms: Occupancy limit is **intentional design choice**

**Grade**: **A (Excellent Engineering)**

---

### **Option B: Try Occupancy Tuning (High Risk)**

**Approach**:
1. Fork xFormers kernel
2. Reduce registers (spill to local memory)
3. Try smaller tiles (32x32)
4. Measure if speedup > spill overhead

**Estimated Effort**: 60-80 hours  
**Success Probability**: 20% (experts already optimized this)  
**Expected Gain**: 10-30% IF successful (33 → 25 μs)

---

### **Option C: Algorithm Change (Very High Risk)**

**Approaches**:
1. FlashAttention-3 (if it exists?)
2. Different tiling strategy
3. Sparse attention (different algorithm)

**Estimated Effort**: 100+ hours  
**Success Probability**: 10% (research-level work)  
**Expected Gain**: Uncertain

## **🎓 Key Lessons**

### **1. NCU Reveals Hidden Tradeoffs**

Before NCU:
> "xFormers is 33.19 μs. Can we beat it?"

After NCU:
> "xFormers trades occupancy for Tensor Core efficiency.  
> This is an **intentional** design choice by experts.  
> To beat it, we'd need to find a BETTER tradeoff."

---

### **2. Low Utilization ≠ Bad Kernel**

**Common Myth**:
> "Low occupancy (9.3%) means bad kernel, should optimize!"

**Reality**:
> "Low occupancy is **intentional** for Tensor Core kernels.  
> Each warp does 32× more work via HMMA instructions.  
> Total throughput = occupancy × work_per_warp.  
> xFormers maximizes the **product**, not just occupancy!"

---

### **3. "Standing on Shoulders" Means Understanding WHY**

**Bad interpretation**:
> "xFormers is 33 μs, I can beat it by increasing occupancy!"

**Good interpretation**:
> "xFormers is 33 μs **because** of low occupancy tradeoff.  
> To beat it, I need a fundamentally different approach,  
> not just tune their existing design."
