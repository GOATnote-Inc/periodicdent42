## 📊 Complete Journey

### Phase 1.1: Fused Kernel Foundation
**Goal**: Fuse QK^T → Softmax → P·V  
**Result**: 986 μs, 0.000488 error ✅  
**Value**: Correctness validated, foundation built

### Phase 1.2: WMMA Tensor Cores
**Goal**: Replace scalar P·V with WMMA  
**Result**: 221 μs (4.45× speedup) ✅  
**Key**: 8-warp layout (2×4) for 32×64 output  
**Error**: 0.000244 (improved!)

### Phase 1.3: Warp-Level Softmax
**Goal**: Warp shuffle reductions  
**Result**: 131 μs (1.70× speedup) ✅  
**Key**: 3× faster softmax component  
**Milestone**: Now faster than unfused baseline!

### Phase 1.4: 64×64 Tiles Assessment
**Goal**: Double tiles for <50 μs  
**Finding**: Static SMEM limited to 48 KB by ptxas ❌  
**Blocker**: 64×64 needs 82 KB (dynamic SMEM required)  
**Decision**: Accept 130 μs as excellent result ✅

---

## 🎓 Critical Technical Findings

### 1. Static vs Dynamic SMEM (Phase 1.4)
**Discovery**: ptxas enforces 48 KB limit on **static** SMEM at **compile time**

```cuda
// Static SMEM (what we used):
struct SharedStorage {
    __shared__ float data[SIZE];  // Compile-time allocation
};
// ptxas sees total size → REJECTS if >48 KB ❌

// Dynamic SMEM (required for >48 KB):
extern __shared__ char smem[];  // Runtime allocation
// ptxas doesn't see size → Must set via cudaFuncSetAttribute ✅
```

**Impact**: 64×64 tiles need 82 KB → requires dynamic SMEM refactoring (6-8h)

### 2. WMMA Fragment Layouts
**Discovery**: Careful warp layout required for correct tile coverage

```
32×32 QK^T: 2×2 warps = 4 warps
32×64 P·V:  2×4 warps = 8 warps
64×64 both: 4×4 warps = 16 warps (blocked by SMEM limit)
```

### 3. Warp Shuffle Efficiency
**Discovery**: Warp reductions are extremely fast

```
Sequential: 32 iterations
Warp shuffle: log2(32) = 5 iterations
Speedup: 3× for softmax component
```

## 🚀 Path Forward (Optional)

### If Continuing to ~65-80 μs:

**Required**: Dynamic SMEM Refactoring (6-8 hours)
```
1. Remove SharedStorage struct
2. Add extern __shared__ char smem[]
3. Calculate all buffer offsets (aligned)
4. Update ALL references (shared.x → x)
5. Test extensively (high bug risk)
```

**Expected Gain**: 130 μs → ~65-80 μs (1.6-2× speedup)

**Additional Optimizations** (3-4 hours):
- Vectorized I/O (float4 loads/stores)
- NCU-guided micro-optimization
- Bank conflict elimination

**Final Expected**: ~65-80 μs (still 3× slower than PyTorch SDPA)
