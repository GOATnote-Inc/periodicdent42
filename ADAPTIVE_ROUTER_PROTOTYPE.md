# Adaptive Router Prototype - EXPERIMENTAL

**Date**: October 1, 2025  
**Status**: Research prototype, not production-ready  
**Confidence**: Low (needs extensive validation)

---

## What We Built

An experimental system that attempts to automatically select between Bayesian Optimization (BO) 
and Reinforcement Learning (RL) based on estimated measurement noise.

### Components

1. **`src/reasoning/adaptive/noise_estimator.py`**
   - Estimates measurement noise from pilot experiments
   - Multiple methods: replicates (best), residuals (good), sequential (weak)
   - Provides confidence intervals and reliability flags
   - **Test coverage**: 74%

2. **`src/reasoning/adaptive/router.py`**
   - Routes to BO vs RL based on noise estimates
   - Provides transparent decision-making with confidence levels
   - Tracks routing history for analysis
   - **Test coverage**: 96%

3. **`app/tests/unit/test_adaptive_router.py`**
   - 21 unit tests covering core functionality
   - Tests edge cases (empty data, NaN, extreme noise)
   - **All tests passing** ✓

## Scientific Framing (Honest)

### What We Know
- RL showed advantage over BO on Branin function at noise=2.0 (p=0.0001, n=10)
- This is **ONE test** on **ONE function** with **small sample size**

### What We Don't Know
- Does this replicate on other test functions?
- What is the actual noise threshold where RL becomes useful?
- Does it work on real hardware with natural noise?
- Is our noise estimation reliable enough for routing decisions?

### Tentative Hypothesis
```
if noise_std < 0.5:
    use BO  # Clear BO territory
elif noise_std < 1.5:
    use BO (conservative) or run both and compare
else:
    consider RL  # Preliminary evidence at σ≥2.0
```

**These thresholds are speculative and may change with more data.**

## Usage (Research Only)

### Basic Example

```python
from src.reasoning.adaptive.router import AdaptiveRouter
from src.reasoning.adaptive.noise_estimator import NoiseEstimator

# Initialize router
router = AdaptiveRouter()

# Provide pilot data (replicated measurements are best)
pilot_data = {
    "replicates": [
        [10.1, 9.9, 10.2],  # 3 measurements at condition 1
        [20.3, 19.8, 20.1],  # 3 measurements at condition 2
    ]
}

# Get routing decision
decision = router.route(pilot_data)

print(f"Recommended method: {decision.method.value}")
print(f"Confidence: {decision.confidence:.1%}")
print(f"Noise estimate: σ={decision.noise_estimate.std:.3f}")
print(f"\nReasoning: {decision.reasoning}")

if decision.warnings:
    print("\n⚠️  Warnings:")
    for warning in decision.warnings:
        print(f"  - {warning}")

# Get detailed explanation
print("\n" + router.explain_decision(decision))
```

### Quick Routing (Prototyping Only)

```python
from src.reasoning.adaptive.router import quick_route

observations = [10.0, 10.5, 9.8, 10.2, 9.9]
method = quick_route(observations)
print(f"Quick recommendation: {method.value}")
```

**WARNING**: Quick routing makes strong assumptions and has no confidence assessment!

## Validation Roadmap

### Phase 1: Replicate the Finding (Critical - 1-2 months)

**Goal**: Determine if RL actually outperforms BO at high noise

1. **Multiple Test Functions**
   - Branin, Ackley, Rastrigin, Rosenbrock, Hartmann6
   - Track: How many show RL advantage? At what noise levels?
   - Sample size: n=30 per condition (not n=10)

2. **Statistical Rigor**
   - Report effect sizes (Cohen's d), not just p-values
   - Confidence intervals on performance differences
   - Correct for multiple comparisons (Bonferroni)

3. **Advanced Baselines**
   - Robust Bayesian Optimization
   - Heteroscedastic GP (noise variance varies)
   - Noisy Expected Improvement

**Success Criteria**: RL shows advantage on ≥3/5 test functions at σ≥2.0 with p<0.01 (corrected)

**Failure Criteria**: RL advantage doesn't replicate → abandon hypothesis, document null result

### Phase 2: Understand the Mechanism (If Phase 1 succeeds - 2-3 months)

1. **Noise Characterization**
   - Heteroscedastic noise (variance changes with input)
   - Non-Gaussian noise (Cauchy, Student-t distributions)
   - Correlated noise (autoregressive)

2. **Ablation Studies**
   - RL without ICM (is curiosity critical?)
   - Different RL algorithms (SAC, TD3, A3C)
   - Different BO variants (UCB vs EI vs PI)

3. **Theoretical Analysis**
   - When/why should RL outperform BO?
   - Can we predict it from problem characteristics?

### Phase 3: Real-World Validation (If Phase 2 succeeds - 3-6 months)

1. **Hardware Experiments**
   - Measure natural noise in XRD, NMR, UV-Vis instruments
   - Run head-to-head comparisons (RL vs BO vs adaptive)
   - Document failure modes and limitations

2. **Customer Pilots**
   - Partner with 2-3 labs in high-noise domains
   - A/B test: RL vs BO vs adaptive router
   - Gather qualitative feedback on perceived value

3. **Production Hardening** (only if validated)
   - Add safety checks (don't route to broken systems)
   - Implement fallback strategies
   - Add monitoring and alerting
   - Document deployment best practices

## Current Limitations (Critical)

### Technical Limitations

1. **Small Sample Size**: n=10 is insufficient for reliable conclusions
2. **Single Test Function**: Branin only - no generalization evidence
3. **Simulated Noise**: Gaussian, additive - may not match real noise
4. **No Hardware Validation**: All results are simulation-based
5. **Tentative Thresholds**: σ=0.5, 1.5, 2.0 are educated guesses, not validated

### Methodological Concerns

1. **No Pre-Registration**: Experiments not pre-registered (risk of p-hacking)
2. **Multiple Comparisons**: No correction for testing multiple noise levels
3. **Hyperparameter Sensitivity**: Results may depend on PPO/BO hyperparameters
4. **Publication Bias**: We haven't documented failed experiments

### Deployment Blockers

1. **Noise Estimation Reliability**: Can we accurately estimate noise from small pilots?
2. **Routing Confidence**: Low confidence decisions default to BO (may never use RL)
3. **Cost of Mistakes**: Wrong routing wastes expensive experiments
4. **User Trust**: Will users trust an adaptive system, or prefer manual control?

## What We Can Say Publicly

### Conservative Statement (Accurate)

> "In preliminary testing on the Branin benchmark function with simulated noise (σ=2.0), 
> we observed that our RL-based optimizer achieved better performance than standard Bayesian 
> Optimization (p=0.0001, n=10 trials). Based on this encouraging preliminary result, 
> we have developed an experimental prototype that attempts to automatically select between 
> optimization algorithms based on estimated noise levels. This prototype requires extensive 
> validation before we can make claims about its effectiveness in real-world applications."

### What We CANNOT Say Yet

❌ "Validated breakthrough in noise-robust optimization"  
❌ "RL beats BO in high-noise environments" (too broad, insufficient evidence)  
❌ "Production-ready adaptive optimization system"  
❌ "Patent-worthy innovation" (needs novelty search, more validation)  
❌ "Proven ROI for customers" (no customer validation yet)

**Bottom Line**: We built an experimental tool to test an interesting hypothesis. 
It may or may not work in practice. We need 3-6 months of rigorous validation before 
making any claims. Honesty and reproducibility are more important than hype.
