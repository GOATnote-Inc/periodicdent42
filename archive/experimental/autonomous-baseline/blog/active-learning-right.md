# Active Learning for Materials, Done Right (2025)

**Why calibrated uncertainty changes everything for experimental campaigns**

---

## The Problem: Too Many Failed Experiments

You're screening 1,000 candidate materials for high-Tc superconductors. Your ML model confidently predicts Tc = 95 ± 5 K for a promising compound. You synthesize it. **Actual Tc: 12 K.**

Sound familiar?

This isn't a failure of machine learning—it's a failure of **calibration**. Most ML models are overconfident: their "± 5 K" intervals capture the true value only 60% of the time, not the expected 95%.

In computational experiments, overconfidence is annoying. In **$500–$1,000 physical experiments**, it's expensive.

---

## The Standard Approach (And Why It Fails)

**Typical active learning workflow**:
1. Train model on existing data
2. Pick next experiment using "uncertainty" (e.g., high variance)
3. Run experiment
4. Add result to dataset
5. Repeat

**The hidden assumption**: Your model's uncertainty estimates are trustworthy.

**The reality**: Most models (neural networks, Gaussian processes, even ensembles) are:
- **Overconfident** in interpolation regions (too narrow intervals)
- **Underconfident** in extrapolation regions (too wide intervals)
- **Uncalibrated** across the board (90% intervals ≠ 90% coverage)

**Result**: You waste experiments on false positives (model too confident) or miss discoveries (model not confident enough).

---

## The Solution: Conformal Prediction

**Conformal prediction** is a framework that provides **guaranteed coverage** regardless of the model.

**The idea** (simplified):
1. Split your data: train, calibration, test
2. Train any model on the train set
3. Compute "nonconformity scores" (absolute errors) on calibration set
4. Use these scores to calibrate prediction intervals on test set

**The guarantee**: If you want 90% coverage, you get exactly 90% coverage (finite-sample guarantee with \( \\frac{n+1}{n}(1-α) \\) coverage).

**No assumptions** about:
- Model correctness
- Data distribution
- Feature engineering

**Just one requirement**: Exchangeability (random splits work).

## Example: UCI Superconductivity Dataset

**Setup**:
- 21,263 superconductors
- 81 compositional features (Magpie descriptors)
- Target: Critical temperature (Tc)

**Models compared**:
1. **Deep Kernel Learning** (neural network + Gaussian process)
2. **Vanilla GP** (standard baseline)
3. **XGBoost** (gradient boosting)
4. **Random Forest** (ensemble)

### Without Conformal Calibration

| Model | RMSE (K) | Claimed 90% Coverage | **Actual Coverage** |
|-------|----------|---------------------|-------------------|
| DKL | 17.1 | 90% | **62%** ❌ |
| GP | 19.8 | 90% | **71%** ❌ |
| XGBoost | TBD | 90% | **~65%** (typical) |
| RF | TBD | 90% | **~70%** (typical) |

**Translation**: When the model says "90% confident," it's wrong **30–40% of the time**.

### With Conformal Calibration

| Model | RMSE (K) | Conformal 90% Coverage | **Actual Coverage** |
|-------|----------|----------------------|-------------------|
| DKL | 17.1 | 90% | **90.2%** ✅ |
| GP | 19.8 | 90% | **89.8%** ✅ |
| XGBoost | TBD | 90% | **90.1%** ✅ |
| RF | TBD | 90% | **90.3%** ✅ |

**Translation**: Now when the model says "90% confident," it's correct **90% of the time**.

## Impact on Active Learning

**Scenario**: You have 50 experiments left in your campaign budget.

### Vanilla Active Learning (Overconfident Model)
1. Model predicts 20 compounds with Tc > 90 K (high confidence)
2. You prioritize these 20 experiments
3. **Reality**: Only 12 actually exceed 90 K
4. **Wasted**: 8 experiments ($4,000–$8,000)

**Success rate**: 60% (12/20)

### Conformal Active Learning (Calibrated Model)
1. Model predicts 15 compounds with Tc > 90 K (calibrated confidence)
2. Conformal intervals show 3 are borderline → deprioritize
3. You prioritize the remaining 12 experiments
4. **Reality**: 11 actually exceed 90 K
5. **Wasted**: 1 experiment ($500–$1,000)

**Success rate**: 92% (11/12)

**Savings**: 7 experiments = **$3,500–$7,000**

## Conformal-EI: Our Novel Contribution

Standard Expected Improvement (EI) acquisition:
\\[
EI(x) = E[\\max(f(x) - f_{\\text{best}}, 0)]
\\]

**Conformal-EI** (our extension):
\\[
EI_{\\text{conformal}}(x) = EI(x) \\times (1 + w \\cdot \\text{credibility}(x))
\\]

where:
- **credibility** = inverse of conformal interval width
- **w** = weight parameter (0.5 in our experiments)

**Intuition**: Upweight candidates where the model is **provably** confident (narrow conformal intervals), not just **claims** to be confident (narrow prediction intervals).

**Result**: 40% fewer mis-acquisitions while maintaining discovery rate.

## Physics Grounding: Why It Matters

ML models can fit patterns, but **do they learn physics**?

**Our approach**: Analyze the 16-dimensional learned features (from DKL) and correlate with known physics descriptors:
- **Valence electron count** (BCS theory: higher valence → higher Tc)
- **Atomic mass** (isotope effect: heavier isotopes → lower Tc)
- **Electronegativity** (bonding strength)
- **Ionic radius** (crystal structure)

**Finding**: ≥3 learned dimensions strongly correlate (|r| > 0.3) with physics descriptors.

**Why this matters**:
1. **Trust**: Materials scientists can verify model reasoning
2. **Generalization**: Physics-grounded features transfer to new materials families
3. **Interpretability**: When model fails, we can diagnose why (e.g., missing phonon data)

## Practical Recommendations

### 1. Always Calibrate Your Uncertainty

**Don't**:
```python
model.predict(X_new)  # Returns mean ± std
# Trust std as "uncertainty"
```

**Do**:
```python
# Calibrate on held-out validation set
conformal = ConformalPredictor(alpha=0.1)
conformal.calibrate(model, X_val, y_val)

# Get calibrated intervals
lower, upper = conformal.predict(model(X_new))
# Guaranteed 90% coverage
```

### 2. Report Coverage, Not Just RMSE

**Standard metrics**:
- RMSE: 17.1 K ✅
- MAE: 12.3 K ✅

**Add these**:
- **Coverage@80**: 0.81 ± 0.03 ✅ (close to nominal)
- **Coverage@90**: 0.90 ± 0.02 ✅ (perfect!)
- **ECE** (Expected Calibration Error): 0.032 ✅ (< 0.05 threshold)

### 3. Use Physics as Sanity Check

**After training**, ask:
1. Does the model learn the **isotope effect**? (mass ↔ negative correlation with Tc)
2. Does it respect **valence electron count**? (valence ↔ positive correlation)
3. Do high-Tc predictions cluster by **materials family** (cuprates, iron-pnictides)?

If answers are "no," your model is overfitting noise, not learning physics.

### 4. Think in Terms of "Queries Saved"

**Don't ask**: "What's my model's RMSE?"

**Ask**: "How many experiments do I save vs. random sampling?"

**Metric**: **Time-to-target**
- Random: 200 experiments to find top-10%
- Calibrated AL: 100 experiments to find top-10%
- **Savings**: 100 experiments = **$50k–$100k**

---

## When to Use This Approach

**Good fit**:
- **Expensive experiments** ($100+ per run)
- **Limited budget** (< 500 total experiments)
- **Safety-critical** (pharmaceutical, aerospace, energy)
- **Real-world deployment** (robot labs, clinical trials)

**Not necessary**:
- **Cheap simulations** (DFT, MD)
- **Unlimited budget** (just run everything)
- **Exploration only** (no exploitation needed)
