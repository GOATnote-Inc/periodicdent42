## 🎯 PERFORMANCE TARGET

```
PyTorch SDPA Baseline (H100): 24.83 μs (measured)

## 📊 ITERATION PROGRESS

### ✅ Phase D.1: Baseline Established

**Status**: Completed  
**Performance**: Not benchmarked (has branches)  
**Security**: 5 predicated branches detected  

```
Compiled: 23KB cubin
SASS: 5 @P BRA instructions
Spills: 0
```

**Learning**: Minimal scalar kernel compiles but needs optimization

---

### 🔄 Phase D.2: Branch Reduction Attempt

**Status**: In Progress (4 branches remaining)  
**Performance**: Not benchmarked  
**Security**: 4 predicated branches  

```
Compiled: 73KB cubin
SASS: 4 @P1 BRA instructions (loop control)
Spills: 0
```

**Analysis**: 
- Reduced from 5 → 4 branches
- Remaining branches appear to be loop control (less critical)
- Inline PTX helped but not sufficient for zero branches

**Decision**: Pivot to performance optimizations, revisit branches later

---

### 🚀 Phase D.3: WMMA Tensor Cores (Current)

**Status**: Code written, ready to test  
**Expected**: 10-20 μs (2× faster than SDPA)  
**Method**:
- Shared memory tiling (24KB per block)
- Cooperative loading (256 threads)
- WMMA preparation (manual dot product for now)
- Tile-based processing (64-token tiles)

**Next**: Deploy to H100 and benchmark

---

### ⏭️ Phase D.4: True WMMA Implementation

**Status**: Planned  
**Expected**: 8-12 μs (3× faster than SDPA)  
**Method**:
- Replace manual dot products with WMMA
- 16×16×16 tiles for Q@K^T and P@V
- FP16 accumulation (Hopper optimized)

---

### ⏭️ Phase D.5: Kernel Fusion + Async

**Status**: Planned  
**Expected**: 5-7 μs (4-5× faster than SDPA)  
**Method**:
- Fuse QK^T + softmax + PV into single kernel
- Async memory copy (cp.async)
- Double buffering
- Warp specialization

---

### ⏭️ Phase D.6: Extreme Optimization

**Status**: Planned  
**Expected**: < 5 μs ✅ (5× target!)  
**Method**:
- XOR swizzling (bank conflicts)
- Custom approximate softmax
- Register pressure optimization
- Loop unrolling tuning

## 🔍 BRANCH STATUS TRACKING

| Phase | Branches | Status | Priority |
|-------|----------|--------|----------|
| D.1 | 5 | ❌ | Low (baseline) |
| D.2 | 4 | ⚠️ | Medium (improved) |
| D.3 | TBD | 🔄 | TBD (testing) |
| Target | 0 | 🎯 | High (final goal) |

**Strategy**: 
1. Achieve < 5 μs performance FIRST
2. Then eliminate remaining branches for security
3. Both goals achievable, but performance is current priority

---

## 📈 EXPECTED PERFORMANCE TRAJECTORY

```
Phase D.1 (Scalar):           ~50-100 μs (baseline, slow)
Phase D.2 (Branch-reduced):   ~40-80 μs (still slow)
Phase D.3 (Shared Mem):       ~10-20 μs (2× faster than SDPA) ✅
Phase D.4 (True WMMA):        ~8-12 μs (3× faster) ✅
Phase D.5 (Fusion):           ~5-7 μs (4-5× faster) ✅
Phase D.6 (Extreme):          < 5 μs (TARGET!) ✅
```

**Critical Insight**: Shared memory + WMMA are the key optimizations  
**Timeline**: 3-4 more iterations to reach < 5 μs

## 🛠️ INFRASTRUCTURE STATUS

### ✅ Working Tools

1. **RunPod H100 Access** (154.57.34.90:36088)
2. **Compilation Pipeline** (nvcc 12.4.131, sm_90)
3. **SASS Validation** (cuobjdump + pattern matching)
4. **Performance Benchmarking** (CUDA events, device-time)
5. **PyTorch SDPA Baseline** (24.83 μs confirmed)

### ✅ Scripts Ready

- `benchmark_vs_sdpa_on_h100.sh` - SDPA baseline
- `benchmark_phase_d2_on_h100.sh` - SASS validation
- `validate_dhp_expert_on_gpu.sh` - Enhanced validation

---

## 🎯 IMMEDIATE NEXT STEPS

### 1. Test Phase D.3 on H100 (NOW)

```bash
# Deploy and benchmark D.3 (shared memory)
bash benchmark_phase_d3_on_h100.sh
```

**Expected Outcome**:
- Compilation successful
- SASS: 3-10 branches (acceptable for now)
- Performance: 10-20 μs (2× faster than SDPA)

### 2. Implement True WMMA (Next)

If D.3 shows ~15 μs:
- Replace manual dot products with WMMA calls
- Use proper 16×16×16 tiling
- Expected: 8-12 μs

### 3. Kernel Fusion (Then)

If D.4 shows ~10 μs:
- Fuse operations to eliminate intermediate writes
- Add async copy (cp.async)
- Expected: 5-7 μs

### 4. Final Optimizations (Last)

If D.5 shows ~6 μs:
- Fine-tune register usage
- Optimize softmax (approximate if needed)
- Custom warp reductions
- Expected: < 5 μs ✅

## 💡 KEY LEARNINGS SO FAR

### What Works

1. ✅ **H100 infrastructure** - Proven working
2. ✅ **SASS validation** - Catches actual issues
3. ✅ **Iterative approach** - Measure each step
4. ✅ **Realistic targets** - 5× speedup is hard but achievable

### What's Challenging

1. ⚠️ **Zero branches** - Harder than expected (4 remaining)
2. ⚠️ **Large register pressure** - 512-element arrays challenging
3. ⚠️ **Performance vs Security trade-off** - May need to balance

### Strategy Adjustment

**Original**: Zero branches first, then optimize  
**Revised**: Optimize for speed first, then fix branches  
**Reason**: User wants "faster than SDPA" - prioritize performance
