## Decision Points

### After Pre-Registration
**Question**: Is the experimental design sound?  
**Decision maker**: Team  
**Date**: [Set date]  

**If NO**: Revise pre-registration (document changes), then proceed  
**If YES**: Proceed to implementation  

### After Pilot Study
**Question**: Are all methods working correctly? Is compute time reasonable?  
**Decision maker**: Technical lead  
**Date**: [Set date]  

**If NO**: Fix issues, re-run pilot  
**If YES**: Proceed to full experiment  

### After Results
**Question**: Which scenario (1-4) occurred?  
**Decision maker**: Team  
**Date**: [Set date]  

**Scenario 1 (H1 confirmed)**: Proceed to Phase 2  
**Scenario 2 (Partial)**: Investigate, refine hypothesis  
**Scenario 3 (Null)**: Document, pivot  
**Scenario 4 (BO better)**: Document, investigate why

## Risk Management

### Technical Risks
- **Compute failures**: Checkpoint/resume system
- **Method bugs**: Pilot study + unit tests
- **Data corruption**: Redundant backups

### Scientific Risks
- **Null result**: Pre-registered, so still valuable
- **Ambiguous result**: Pre-specified interpretation criteria
- **Can't reproduce preliminary finding**: Document honestly

### Timeline Risks
- **Experiments take longer than expected**: Budget buffer time
- **Resource conflicts**: Reserve compute ahead of time
- **Analysis delays**: Start analysis pipeline early

## Notes

**Why this checklist exists**:
We want to ensure Phase 1 validation is done rigorously, transparently, and reproducibly.
This checklist prevents shortcuts and ensures we follow scientific best practices.

**Update frequency**: 
Update this checklist weekly during setup, daily during experiment run, and as items 
complete during analysis.

**Deviations**:
Any deviations from this plan should be documented in `RESEARCH_LOG.md` with justification.
