AUC-ROC ≥ 0.90: 1.000 | Target: ≥ 0.90 | ✅ PASS

OVERALL: ✅ ALL CRITERIA MET

INTERPRETATION
--------------

✅ OOD DETECTION: SUCCESSFUL

The Mahalanobis distance detector successfully identifies out-of-distribution samples 
with high accuracy (AUC=1.000) and achieves 100.0% true positive rate 
at 10% false positive rate.

This validates the framework's ability to flag novel compounds for human review in an 
autonomous synthesis pipeline. The detector can be used as a safety mechanism to prevent 
synthesis of compounds far from the training distribution.

Deployment-ready for autonomous GO/NO-GO decisions with OOD flagging.
