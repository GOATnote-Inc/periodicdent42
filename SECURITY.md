# Security Policy

## üîí Reporting a Vulnerability

**Periodic Labs** takes security seriously. If you discover a security vulnerability in this project, please report it responsibly.

### **How to Report**

**DO NOT** open a public GitHub issue for security vulnerabilities.

Instead, please email: **B@thegoatnote.com**

**Subject**: "Security Vulnerability - [Brief Description]"

**Include**:
1. Description of the vulnerability
2. Steps to reproduce
3. Potential impact
4. Suggested fix (if you have one)

### **What to Expect**

- **Response Time**: Within 24 hours (usually faster)
- **Fix Timeline**: Critical issues patched within 7 days
- **Credit**: We'll credit you in the fix (unless you prefer anonymity)
- **Disclosure**: Coordinated disclosure after patch is released

## üõ°Ô∏è Safety-Critical Systems

This project includes code for **autonomous operation of laboratory equipment**.

### **Safety Incidents**

If you encounter a **safety issue** during operation:

1. **STOP** all experiments immediately
2. **Emergency stop** (hardware button or software command)
3. **Report** to: B@thegoatnote.com (Subject: "SAFETY INCIDENT")
4. **Document**: Take photos, save logs, note conditions

**Safety is our #1 priority.** We will investigate all incidents promptly.

## üîê Security Best Practices

### **For Users**

1. **Secrets Management**
   - Never commit API keys, passwords, or tokens to git
   - Use environment variables or secret management services
   - Use the provided `.env.example` as a template

2. **Network Security**
   - Run on private networks when possible
   - Use HTTPS for all external communication
   - Restrict firewall access to necessary ports only

3. **Access Control**
   - Implement role-based access control (RBAC) in production
   - Use strong passwords for all accounts
   - Enable 2FA wherever possible

4. **Updates**
   - Keep dependencies up to date (Dependabot enabled)
   - Monitor GitHub security alerts
   - Test updates in staging before production

### **For Contributors**

1. **Code Review**
   - All code changes require PR review
   - Security-sensitive changes require 2+ reviewers
   - CI/CD must pass before merge

2. **Dependencies**
   - Only add vetted, maintained dependencies
   - Check licenses for compatibility
   - Run `pip audit` or `safety check` regularly

3. **Testing**
   - Include security tests for new features
   - Test safety interlocks thoroughly
   - Run static analysis (bandit, semgrep)

## üö® Known Security Considerations

### **Hardware Control**

This system controls **physical laboratory equipment**.

**Risks**:
- X-ray exposure (XRD)
- Chemical hazards (automated synthesis)
- High temperatures/pressures

**Mitigations**:
- Safety kernel enforces limits (Rust implementation)
- Dead-man switch (5-second heartbeat)
- Emergency stop functionality
- Interlock monitoring
- Dry-run mode for testing

### **AI Safety**

The AI system autonomously selects experiments.

**Risks**:
- AI suggests unsafe parameters
- Optimization explores dangerous regions
- Misinterpretation of results

**Mitigations**:
- Hard limits enforced by safety kernel (AI cannot override)
- Human-in-the-loop for critical decisions
- Glass-box explainability (all decisions logged)
- Simulated validation before hardware execution

### **Data Integrity**

Experiment results inform future decisions.

**Risks**:
- Data tampering
- Sensor failures
- Corrupted provenance

**Mitigations**:
- SHA-256 hashing for all data
- Immutable audit logs
- Sensor health checks
- Redundant measurements

## üì¶ Supply Chain Security

### **Dependencies**

We monitor and audit all dependencies:
- **Dependabot**: Automated vulnerability scanning
- **GitHub Security Advisories**: Manual review
- **SBOM**: Software Bill of Materials available

### **CI/CD Security**

- All workflows run in isolated containers
- Secrets managed via GitHub Secrets
- Signed commits encouraged (GPG)
- Least-privilege IAM for cloud deployments
