**Response**: We don't skip steps‚Äîwe parallelize them. EIG optimization means fewer failed experiments, not less rigor.

### "AI can't replace human intuition"
**Response**: We augment, not replace. AI handles the search space exploration; your scientists handle the insights. It's a co-pilot, not autopilot.

### "Our IP is too sensitive"
**Response**: On-premise deployment. Your data never leaves. We provide the orchestration layer, you own the discoveries.

### "ROI unclear"
**Response**: Typical materials program: 3-5 years, $10-50M. If we cut that in half, what's the value? Plus earlier revenue from faster time-to-market.
