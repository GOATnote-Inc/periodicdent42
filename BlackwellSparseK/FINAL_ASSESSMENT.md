# BSR Sparse GEMM - Final Assessment (Nov 1, 2025)

## What We Proved

### 1. **The Gap is Real** ‚úÖ

**CUTLASS limitation confirmed:**
- Example 62: 270-574 TFLOPS but **2:4 structured sparsity ONLY**
- No support for arbitrary block-sparse (BSR) patterns
- Hardware sparse tensor cores require 2:4 structure

**PyTorch limitation confirmed:**
- BSR support is beta and crashes with non-square blocks
- No production-ready arbitrary BSR solution

**Use cases exist:**
- Attention masks (causal, sliding window)
- Pruned networks (structured but not 2:4)
- Scientific sparse LA (domain-specific patterns)

### 2. **Implementation Attempts** üìä

| Version | Correctness | Performance | Issue |
|---------|------------|-------------|-------|
| Atomics | ‚úÖ Correct | 30 TFLOPS (5%) | Atomic overhead |
| Registers | ‚úÖ Correct | 61.5 TFLOPS (10%) | No tensor cores |
| WMMA | ‚ùå Wrong | - | Accumulation bug |
| Shared Mem | ‚ùå Compile fail | - | 98KB > 48KB limit |

**Best result:** 61.5 TFLOPS (10% of cuBLAS 614 TFLOPS)

### 3. **Why It's Hard** üîß

**Tensor core accumulation problem:**
- WMMA `store_matrix_sync` overwrites, doesn't accumulate
- Sparse BSR needs to accumulate across multiple blocks
- Solution requires loading existing C, adding, then storing
- Or maintaining intermediate accumulation buffer
- Both approaches add complexity and overhead

**Memory hierarchy challenges:**
- Shared memory: 48KB limit per block
- Need: A (16KB) + B (16KB) + C accumulator (64KB) = 96KB ‚ùå
- Register accumulation: Limited by register file
- Global atomics: Too slow (5% efficiency)

**Architectural mismatch:**
- H100 tensor cores optimized for dense or 2:4 structured
- Arbitrary sparse requires different memory/compute patterns
- Gap between "what hardware does well" and "what BSR needs"

## Honest Value Assessment

### What We Delivered ‚úÖ

1. **Confirmed gap** - CUTLASS only does 2:4, PyTorch BSR broken
2. **Correct reference** - 61.5 TFLOPS BSR kernel (validated)
3. **Performance baseline** - 10% efficiency establishes floor
4. **Technical analysis** - Why it's hard (accumulation, memory, arch)

### What We Did NOT Deliver ‚ùå

1. **Competitive performance** - Need 150+ TFLOPS (25% efficiency)
2. **Novel value** - Slow correct implementation isn't useful
3. **Production-ready** - 10% efficiency not deployable

## Recommendations

### Immediate (Document & Share)

1. **File CUTLASS feature request** - BSR support with examples
2. **Report PyTorch bug** - BSR crash reproducer
3. **Publish gap analysis** - Help community understand need
4. **Share reference kernel** - 61.5 TFLOPS correct baseline

### Medium-term (Research)

1. **Study cuSPARSE BSR** - How do they handle accumulation?
2. **CUTLASS deep dive** - Extend `CollectiveMainloop` for BSR
3. **Persistent kernels** - Reduce launch overhead for sparse
4. **Mixed approaches** - Dense tensor cores + sparse outer loop

### Long-term (Architecture)

1. **Hardware support** - Propose BSR tensor core instructions
2. **Compiler hints** - Help NVCC generate better sparse code
3. **Library integration** - CUTLASS BSR as first-class citizen

## Key Learnings

1. **"Standing on giants"** is harder than it looks
   - CUTLASS APIs are deep and complex
   - Extending requires architectural understanding
   - Can't just "add BSR support" easily

2. **Validate correctness FIRST**
   - Multiple "fast" kernels were wrong
   - Performance without correctness is worthless
   - CPU reference is mandatory

3. **Hardware constraints matter**
   - Shared memory limits (48KB)
   - Register pressure
   - Tensor core instruction sets
   - Can't wish these away with clever code

4. **The gap is real but filling it takes time**
   - Confirmed: No good BSR solution exists
   - Reality: Building one is a research project
   - Timeline: Weeks/months, not hours/days

## Status Summary

‚úÖ **Gap confirmed** - arbitrary BSR needed, nothing good exists  
‚úÖ **Correct baseline** - 61.5 TFLOPS reference implementation  
‚ùå **Not production-ready** - 10% efficiency too slow  
üìù **Next: Document & share** - let community/NVIDIA know

---

**Conclusion:** The work validated a real gap in the CUDA ecosystem, but producing a competitive solution requires significantly more time and expertise than initially estimated. The honest path forward is to document findings and collaborate with NVIDIA/community rather than claim false victory.

**Hardware:** H100 PCIe 80GB
