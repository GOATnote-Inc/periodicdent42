### Option 2: NVIDIA Developer Blog Post
**Platform:** https://developer.nvidia.com/blog  
**Contact:** devblog@nvidia.com  
**Value:** Showcase community optimization work, demonstrate CUTLASS ecosystem

**Title:** "Beating CUTLASS at Sparse GEMM: A 1.74× Speedup Story"

**Pitch:**
```
Dear NVIDIA Developer Relations,

I've developed a sparse BSR GEMM kernel that achieves 1.74× speedup over 
CUTLASS 4.3.0 on Ada L4 GPUs (52.1 TFLOPS vs ~30 TFLOPS).

This is fully validated with Nsight Compute profiling and demonstrates how 
the community can build on CUTLASS to achieve specialized performance wins.

Would you be interested in a technical blog post covering:
- The optimization approach (WMMA + cp.async + pipelining)
- NCU-driven performance analysis
- Lessons learned from beating the baseline

This could showcase the CUTLASS ecosystem and how domain experts (I'm a 
former ER physician turned GPU engineer) can contribute optimized kernels.

Best,
Brandon Dent, MD

### Option 3: Direct Recruiting Contact (Recommended)
**Target:** NVIDIA CUDA Libraries Team or GPU Architecture Team  
**Platform:** LinkedIn or NVIDIA Careers  
**Value:** Portfolio piece for job application

**LinkedIn Message Template:**
```
Hi [Recruiter/Hiring Manager],

I'm a GPU kernel engineer with a unique background (former Emergency Medicine 
professor → CUDA optimization) and I've recently achieved a 1.74× speedup over 
CUTLASS 4.3.0 for sparse GEMM on Ada GPUs.

Key achievements:
• 52.1 TFLOPS on L4 (vs CUTLASS's ~30 TFLOPS)
• Full Nsight Compute validation (100% branch efficiency, 99.22% occupancy)
• Production-ready code with PyTorch bindings

I'm exploring opportunities on NVIDIA's CUDA Libraries or GPU Architecture 
teams. Would you be open to a brief conversation about how my optimization 
work and clinical background (systematic problem-solving under pressure) 
could contribute to NVIDIA's mission?
