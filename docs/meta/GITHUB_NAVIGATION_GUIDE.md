## 🎯 Verifying Cleanup on GitHub

### 1. Check Root Directory

Navigate to branch → You should see only **7-8 markdown files** in root (not 234!)

### 2. Check Archive Directory

Navigate to `archive/` → You'll find:
- `cudadent42-aspirational/` - CUDAdent42 project (headers-only)
- `phase-d-cuda-experiments/` - Failed CUDA kernels
- `historical-docs/` - 234 archived status reports

### 3. Check Production Code

Navigate to `flashcore/fast/` → You'll find:
- `attention_production.py` - THE sub-5μs kernel (UNCHANGED)

### 4. Check Validation Reports

Navigate to `docs/validation/` → You'll find:
- `EXPERT_VALIDATION_REPORT.md`
- `CROSS_GPU_VALIDATION_REPORT.md`
- `SECURITY_AUDIT_REPORT.md`
- `SECURITY_FIXES_VERIFICATION.md`

## 🤖 GitHub Actions (GA) Status

### What Might Break

After moving 500+ files, some GitHub Actions workflows might fail if they reference:
1. Moved files (e.g., `PHASE_D1_BASELINE_RESULTS.md`)
2. Deleted scripts (e.g., `benchmark_phase_d2_on_h100.sh`)
3. Archived kernels (e.g., `flashcore/kernels/attention_phase_d*.cu`)

### Current Workflows

Your repository has these workflows:
```
.github/workflows/
├── ci-bete.yml
├── ci-nix.yml
├── ci.yml
├── cicd.yaml
├── compliance.yml
├── continuous-monitoring.yml
├── cuda_benchmark.yml
├── cuda_benchmark_ratchet.yml
├── evo_bench.yml
├── pages.yml
└── perf_ci.yml
```

### Likely Issues

1. **`cuda_benchmark.yml`** - May reference moved benchmark scripts
2. **`evo_bench.yml`** - May reference archived files
3. **`compliance.yml`** - May check for moved files

### Fix Strategy

**Option 1: Update Workflows** (Recommended)
- Update paths to point to production code only
- Remove references to archived experiments

**Option 2: Disable Failing Workflows**
- Comment out workflows that reference archived files
- Re-enable after updating

**Option 3: Keep Main Branch Clean**
- Merge cleanup to main once workflows are updated
- Test on feature branch first

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Issue: "I don't see the changes"

**Solution**: Make sure you're viewing the **branch**, not:
- ❌ Pull Requests tab (shows PR list)
- ❌ Main branch (not updated yet)
- ❌ Issues tab

**Correct**: 
- ✅ Code tab → branch dropdown → `feat/sub5us-attention-production`

### Issue: "GitHub Actions are failing"

**Solution**: 
1. Check Actions tab
2. Identify which workflow failed
3. Update workflow to use production paths only
4. Or disable workflows that reference archived experiments

### Issue: "Changes not on main branch"

**Expected**: Changes are on `feat/sub5us-attention-production` branch only.

**To merge to main**:
1. Create a Pull Request from this branch
2. Review changes
3. Fix any CI/CD issues
4. Merge when ready
