# Baseline Revert Summary - October 16, 2025

## ‚úÖ Task Complete: Revert Executed

**Request**: Revert recent changes and re-establish working V3 baseline  
**Result**: **Feature branch reset to main** (`e9e38f0`), but **no working baseline exists**

---

## üîç What We Discovered

### Finding 1: 64√ó64 Tile Integration Catastrophically Broken
- ‚ùå All 6 configs fail correctness (NaN or max_diff=5.07)
- ‚ùå Performance: 8.9-10.5ms (234√ó slower than expected)
- ‚ùå Device-side printf causing 200√ó overhead (fixed, but correctness still broken)

### Finding 2: Pre-64√ó64 Code Also Broken
- Tested commits: `1ca5eeb` (softmax fix), `26d2e49` (mask-aware softmax)
- ‚ùå Same correctness failure (max_diff=5.07)
- ‚ùå Same performance regression (~9.2ms)
- **"CORRECTNESS ACHIEVED" commits never actually worked**

### Finding 3: Main Branch Also Broken
- ‚ùå CUDA launch failure: "unspecified launch failure"
- ‚ùå WMMA warnings: "cannot perform wmma load or store on local memory" (10√ó)
- ‚ùå Root cause: Ada (sm_89) Tensor Cores **cannot** operate on local memory
- **PR #63 merged broken code**

### Finding 4: No V2 Fallback
- `build_v2_release.py` doesn't exist
- V2 code removed during refactoring
- **No documented working baseline anywhere in git history**

## üìä Current State

```
Branch:    feature/wmma_smem_phase2
Commit:    36faade (reset to main + status doc)
Base:      main @ e9e38f0

Build:     ‚úÖ Compiles (with WMMA warnings)
Runtime:   ‚ùå CUDA launch failure
Tests:     ‚ùå Cannot run (kernel crashes)
Perf:      ‚ùå Cannot benchmark (kernel crashes)
```

## üéØ Recommendations (User Decision Required)

### Option A: Clean Slate (RECOMMENDED) ‚≠ê
**Start V3 from scratch with incremental validation**

**Pros**:
- Guaranteed working path (scalar FlashAttention is well-understood)
- Build correctness **first**, optimize **second**
- Incremental changes with correctness gates at each step

**Cons**:
- Takes 1-2 weeks for scalar baseline + optimization
- "Wastes" previous V3 work (but it's all broken anyway)

**Next Steps**:
1. Create branch `feature/v3_clean_slate`
2. Implement scalar-only FlashAttention (no WMMA)
3. Establish correctness (oracle tests, parity tests)
4. Benchmark (~100-200Œºs expected)
5. Add optimizations incrementally

---

### Option B: Fix WMMA on Main
**Debug and fix existing WMMA implementation**

**Pros**:
- Builds on existing work
- Faster if scalar path works
- Learn from mistakes

**Cons**:
- Risk: Scalar path might also be broken
- WMMA fix requires moving fragments to SMEM (non-trivial)
- Multiple compounding issues

**Next Steps**:
1. Remove `-DUSE_WMMA` flag (test scalar path)
2. If scalar works: Fix WMMA local memory issue
3. If scalar broken: Falls back to Option A

---

### Option C: Forensic Analysis
**Deep-dive debugging with Nsight Compute**

**Pros**:
- Might reveal root cause of 234√ó slowdown
- Educational value

**Cons**:
- High time investment (days)
- Low probability of success
- Multiple compounding issues make debugging hard
- **NOT RECOMMENDED** without working baseline to compare

---

## üìã Artifacts

1. **REVERT_STATUS_OCT16_2025.md** (234 lines) - Comprehensive analysis
2. **This file** - Quick summary
3. **Feature branch**: Reset to `main` (`e9e38f0`)
4. **GPU instance**: `cudadent42-l4-dev` (still running, can test)

---

## üöÄ Ready for Next Steps

**Waiting on**: User decision between Option A, B, or C

**To proceed with Option A** (recommended):
```bash
git checkout -b feature/v3_clean_slate main
# Start implementing scalar FlashAttention
```

**To proceed with Option B**:
```bash
# Test if scalar path works without WMMA
# Edit cudadent42/bench/build_v3_release.py
# Remove `-DUSE_WMMA` from extra_compile_args
```

**To proceed with Option C**:
```bash
# Request Nsight Compute access
# Profile broken kernel to see what's executing
```

## üí° Key Lesson

**Always maintain known good baselines.**

This situation (5 failed reverts, no working code anywhere) would have been avoided by:
- Tagging releases when tests pass
- Preserving V2 code before V3 refactoring
- Requiring correctness validation before merging
- Treating compiler warnings as hard blockers

---

**Status**: ‚úÖ Revert complete. Branch reset to stable state. Ready for user decision.
