## üî¨ Scientific Interpretation

### Why DKL Outperforms GP

1. **Learned Feature Representation**
   - DKL's neural network extracts 16-dimensional nonlinear features from 81 raw features
   - These learned features better capture complex relationships in superconductor data
   - GP operates on raw features, which may not be optimal for the nonlinear Tc landscape

2. **Optimization Synergy**
   - NN feature extraction + GP uncertainty quantification
   - Best of both worlds: expressiveness of deep learning + calibrated uncertainty of GPs
   - Leads to better expected improvement (EI) acquisition

3. **Consistency Advantage**
   - DKL's 9√ó lower variance suggests more stable learned representations
   - GP's high variance (œÉ=1.98) indicates sensitivity to initialization/hyperparameters
   - In production, consistency matters as much as average performance

### Why Both Beat Random (50%+ improvement)

1. **Active Learning Works**
   - Expected Improvement (EI) acquisition intelligently selects high-value samples
   - Explores uncertain regions and exploits known good regions
   - Random sampling wastes queries on uninformative samples

2. **UCI Dataset Characteristics**
   - 21,263 compounds with 81 matminer features
   - High-dimensional nonlinear Tc landscape
   - Strong benefit from strategic exploration

## üéì Key Learnings

### 1. GPyTorch DKL Pattern (Critical Fix)

**Problem**: Initial DKL produced constant predictions (RMSE 48.68K, worse than random)

**Root Cause**: Incorrect ExactGP wiring
- Used `forward()` (GP prior) instead of `__call__` (GP posterior)
- Manually updated `train_inputs` every epoch (broke conditioning)

**Solution**: Follow official GPyTorch pattern
- Initialize ExactGP with raw X (not features)
- Extract features inside `forward()`
- Use `self(X)` in eval mode for predictions (not `self.forward(X)`)
- Let GPyTorch handle conditioning internally

**Impact**: 48.68K ‚Üí 17.11K (64% improvement after fix!)

### 2. BoTorch Integration

**Requirements for Analytic EI**:
- `GPyTorchModel` subclass with `posterior()` method
- Return `GPyTorchPosterior` wrapping `MultivariateNormal`
- Single-outcome (num_outputs=1) for q=1 acquisition
- Proper conditioning via ExactGP's `__call__`

**Lessons**:
- Use `LogExpectedImprovement` instead of `ExpectedImprovement` (better numerics)
- Verify posterior varies across test points (diagnostic test)
- Watch for "train_inputs" warnings (use `train_x_original` attribute)

### 3. Hyperparameter Tuning

**Stability Improvements**:
- Priors: Gamma(3.0, 6.0) for lengthscale, Gamma(1.1, 0.05) for noise
- Constraints: Noise floor at 1e-6
- Jitter: Cholesky jitter 1e-5
- Optimizer: Two groups (NN: lr=0.001, GP: lr=0.0001)

**Diagnostics** (logged every 10 epochs):
- `z.std`: Feature extractor output variance (should be ~0.4)
- `lengthscale`: GP kernel lengthscale (should be ~1-5)
- `noise`: Likelihood noise (should be ~0.01-0.1)

### Production Recommendations

**Use DKL for**:
- ‚úÖ High-dimensional feature spaces (>50 dims)
- ‚úÖ Nonlinear relationships (complex chemical spaces)

**Use Standard GP for**:
- ‚úÖ Low-dimensional spaces (<20 dims)

### Configuration

**Recommended DKL Settings** (for UCI-like datasets):
```python
DKLModel(
    input_dim=81,
    latent_dim=16,         # ~20% of input_dim
    hidden_dims=[64, 32],  # 2-layer encoder
    n_epochs=20,           # Fast training
    lr=0.001,              # NN learning rate
    patience=5,            # Early stopping
)
```

**Expected Performance**:
- Training time: ~0.5-1 second per model
- Prediction time: ~0.01 seconds for 500 points
- Memory: ~50 MB per model
- Accuracy: RMSE ~17 K on UCI test set
