# Analytics Dashboard - Deployment Status

**Date:** October 3, 2025, 1:32 AM PST  
**Current State:** üü° **PARTIALLY WORKING**

---

## üåê Production URLs

**Service:** https://ard-backend-dydzexswua-uc.a.run.app  
**Health Check:** ‚úÖ Working (returns {"status":"ok"})  
**Analytics Dashboard:** ‚ö†Ô∏è Returns 404  
**API Endpoints:** ‚ö†Ô∏è Return database errors (expected - no Cloud SQL)

---

## üîç Issue Identified

The static files (`analytics.html`, etc.) are not being served by Cloud Run, even though:
- ‚úÖ Files exist locally in `app/static/`
- ‚úÖ Dockerfile copies files with `COPY . .`
- ‚úÖ FastAPI route `/analytics.html` is configured
- ‚úÖ Static file mounting code is present in main.py
- ‚ùå Debug logs don't show STATIC_DIR information

**Root Cause:** The static directory may not be in the correct location in the Docker container, or the path resolution is incorrect in the Cloud Run environment.

---

## ‚úÖ What Works Locally

- ‚úÖ **Server:** http://localhost:8080/analytics.html
- ‚úÖ **Static Files:** All files served correctly
- ‚úÖ **Database:** 95 experiments, 10 runs, 50 queries
- ‚úÖ **Charts:** Render without stretching
- ‚úÖ **API Endpoints:** All working with data

## üéØ Recommended Solution

Given the time spent debugging, here are the best options:

### **Option 1: Use Cloud Storage for Static Files** ‚≠ê (Recommended)
Deploy static files to Cloud Storage bucket and serve from there:
```bash
# Create bucket
gsutil mb -p periodicdent42 gs://periodicdent42-static/

# Upload static files
gsutil -m cp -r app/static/* gs://periodicdent42-static/

# Make public
gsutil iam ch allUsers:objectViewer gs://periodicdent42-static

# Access at:
https://storage.googleapis.com/periodicdent42-static/analytics.html
```

**Pros:**
- Fast CDN delivery
- Separate from application code
- Easy to update independently
- No container rebuilds for UI changes

### **Option 2: Fix Docker Path Resolution**
Update the Dockerfile to explicitly copy static files:
```dockerfile
# Add after COPY . .
COPY static /app/static
RUN ls -la /app/static  # Verify files are there
```

### **Option 3: Serve from Application Root**
Change static files to be served from `/` instead of `/static/`:
```python
app.mount("/", StaticFiles(directory=str(STATIC_DIR), html=True), name="static")
```

### **Option 4: Focus on Cloud SQL Instead**
Since the main blocker for live data is Cloud SQL (not static files), prioritize:
1. Set up Cloud SQL instance
2. Generate test data in production
3. Revisit static files after data is flowing
