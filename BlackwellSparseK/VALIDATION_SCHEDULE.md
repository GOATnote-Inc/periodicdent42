## Risk Assessment

### High Risk Items (Could Block Release)

1. **Nsight validation fails** (SM% < 60%)
   - Mitigation: Investigate with NCU, optimize if needed
   - Fallback: Delay release, fix issues
   - Impact: 1 week delay

2. **Security issues found** (credentials, vulnerabilities)
   - Mitigation: Fix immediately, re-scan
   - Fallback: Strip affected files, rewrite history
   - Impact: 2-3 days delay

3. **Correctness failures** (edge cases crash/wrong)
   - Mitigation: Add input validation, fix bugs
   - Fallback: Document limitations, warn users
   - Impact: 3-5 days delay

### Medium Risk Items (Could Delay Release)

4. **Legal concerns** (patent, export control)
   - Mitigation: Work with legal team
   - Fallback: Relicense, add disclaimers
   - Impact: 1 week delay

5. **Performance regression** (other configs slower)
   - Mitigation: Document optimal use cases
   - Fallback: Add runtime autotuning
   - Impact: 2-3 days delay

### Low Risk Items (Won't Block Release)

6. **Documentation incomplete**
   - Mitigation: Iterate post-release
   - Impact: Community confusion (fixable)

7. **CI issues on public repo**
   - Mitigation: Use badges, fix async
   - Impact: Minor inconvenience
