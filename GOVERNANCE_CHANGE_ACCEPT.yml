# Governance Change Acceptance
#
# Waivers for temporary regression acceptance with expiration.
# Use sparingly and document rationale clearly.
#
# Format per waiver:
#   - metric: <metric_name>           # e.g., ece, coverage, brier
#     reason: "<explanation>"          # Why this regression is acceptable
#     pr: <pr_number>                  # PR number (for tracking)
#     expires_at: "YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SSZ" # ISO 8601 UTC timestamp
#     max_delta: <float>               # Maximum allowed delta from baseline (optional)
#     min_value: <float>               # Minimum acceptable value (optional)
#     max_value: <float>               # Maximum acceptable value (optional)

waivers:
  # Example waiver (remove or modify for actual use):
  # - metric: ece
  #   reason: "Intentional calibration trade-off for new temperature scaling"
  #   pr: 123
  #   expires_at: "2025-12-31T23:59:59Z"
  #   max_delta: 0.03
  # 
  # - metric: coverage
  #   reason: "Codegen spike; comprehensive tests coming in next PR"
  #   pr: 124
  #   expires_at: "2025-11-15T00:00:00Z"
  #   min_value: 0.80

# Notes:
# - Waivers apply ONLY if:
#   1. PR number matches (if in PR context)
#   2. Current time < expires_at
#   3. Regression within specified bounds
# - Expired waivers are automatically ignored
# - Waived regressions appear in reports with ⚠️ warning
