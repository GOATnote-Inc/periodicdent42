# FlashCore Phase 3 Status - Comprehensive Debugging

**Date**: October 22, 2025  
**Current Error**: 4.28 (target: <0.05)  
**Performance**: 373 μs (3.75× vs baseline)

## 🎯 What We Know (Verified Facts)

### ✅ Components That Work
1. **Q@K^T (WMMA)**: **PERFECT** ✅
   - DEBUG_QK_ONLY mode: first query matches exactly
   - K^T layout (sKT[D][N]): Correct
   - WMMA loads/stores: Correct
   
2. **Build Quality**: **EXCELLENT** ✅
   - 92 registers, 32KB SMEM, 0 spills
   - Compiles cleanly
   - No obvious resource issues

3. **Algorithm Structure**: **CORRECT** ✅
   - Rescales U when m changes: `U *= exp(m_old - m_new)`
   - Updates l correctly: `l_new = l_old * exp(m_old - m_new) + l_add`
   - Final normalization: `O = U / l`

### ❌ What's Broken
1. **Full kernel output**: max_err = 4.28 (vs target <0.05)
2. **Single tile test**: max_err = 7.03 (even with only 1 tile!)
3. **Error is large**: Not a precision issue (0.01), but a logic bug

## 🐛 Bug Isolation Results

### Test 1: DEBUG_QK_ONLY
```
Result: ✅ PASS (first query perfect match)
Conclusion: Q@K^T is correct
```

### Test 2: DEBUG_SOFTMAX_ONLY
```
Result: ❌ FAIL (max_err = 0.57 with division, 4.43 without)
Row sums: Ours=[1.0, 1.0, ...], Ref=[0.0664, 0.0626, ...]
Conclusion: Softmax normalization issue, but unclear
```

### Test 3: Single Tile (S=32)
```
Result: ❌ FAIL (max_err = 7.03)
Conclusion: Bug is NOT in multi-tile accumulation
```

## 🤔 Hypotheses (Ordered by Likelihood)

### Hypothesis 1: P@V Accumulation Bug (70%)
**Issue**: atomicAdd race conditions or WMMA fragment mapping errors

**Evidence**:
- Q@K^T is perfect
- Softmax values look plausible (sum to 1.0)
- But final output is wrong

**Test**: Create DEBUG_PV_ONLY mode to isolate P@V

### Hypothesis 2: U Rescaling Timing (20%)
**Issue**: We rescale U before computing P, but maybe there's a race condition

**Evidence**:
- U rescaling happens at lines 340-344
- But multiple threads update U_smem
- Maybe not synchronized properly?

**Test**: Add more `__syncthreads()` barriers

### Hypothesis 3: Warp Partitioning Bug (10%)
**Issue**: k-partitioning doesn't cover all elements or double-counts

**Evidence**:
- Code looks correct, but maybe edge case?

**Test**: Single-warp version (remove partitioning)

## 📊 Error Progression

```
Initial (broken):                7.87  ━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
After Phase 1 fixes:             3.78  ━━━━━━━━━━ (51% better)
After K^T transpose:             4.27  ━━━━━━━━━━━
After softmax /l_new fix:        0.45  ━━ (89% better!)  ← This was promising!
After removing /l_new (current): 4.28  ━━━━━━━━━━━ (reverted)

Single tile (S=32):              7.03  ━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
```

**Key Insight**: When we divided P by l_new, error dropped to 0.45! But this violates the FlashAttention algorithm (double normalization). Yet it was much closer to correct!

## 💡 Next Steps (Ranked by Priority)

### Priority 1: DEBUG_PV_ONLY Gate (30 min)
**Goal**: Isolate P@V computation

```cuda
#ifndef DEBUG_PV_ONLY
#define DEBUG_PV_ONLY 0
#endif

#if DEBUG_PV_ONLY
// Use known-correct P (e.g., uniform), test just P@V
for (int m = 0; m < TILE_M; ++m) {
    for (int n = 0; n < TILE_N; ++n) {
        sP[m][n] = __float2half(1.0f / TILE_N);  // Uniform attention
    }
}
// Then run P@V and compare with PyTorch
#endif
```

**Expected**: Identifies if bug is in P@V or softmax

### Priority 2: Remove AtomicAdd (1 hour)
**Goal**: Eliminate potential atomicAdd race conditions

**Approach**: Use warp-partitioned accumulation without atomics
- Each warp writes to unique (m, d) coordinates
- Requires careful index mapping

**Expected**: If atomicAdd is the issue, this fixes it

### Priority 3: Compare with Working Baseline (30 min)
**Goal**: Start from `flashcore_vec.cu` (which works) and incrementally add WMMA

**Approach**:
1. Take `flashcore_vec.cu` (546 μs, correct)
2. Add WMMA for Q@K^T only
3. Test correctness
4. Add WMMA for P@V
5. Test correctness
6. Add online softmax

**Expected**: Finds where the bug was introduced

### Priority 4: Simplify Algorithm (2 hours)
**Goal**: Write minimal fused kernel without optimizations

**Approach**:
- No WMMA (use scalar)
- No atomics (serial accumulation)
- No warp partitioning
- Just implement basic FlashAttention algorithm

**Expected**: Establishes correct baseline to build from

## 🎓 Lessons Learned

### What Worked
1. **Systematic debugging**: DEBUG gates isolated bug location quickly
2. **Testing in isolation**: QK-only test proved Q@K^T was correct
3. **Single-tile test**: Ruled out multi-tile accumulation as cause

### What Was Challenging
1. **WMMA semantics**: Fragment layouts are non-trivial
2. **Online softmax**: Complex interplay between m, l, U updates
3. **Atomic synchronization**: Hard to reason about correctness

### Key Insight
**The 0.45 error when dividing P by l_new suggests the bug is NOT in softmax normalization, but in how P@V or final O computation works!**

If we divide P by l_new (making P normalized per-tile), we get 0.45 error.
If we don't divide P (making P unnormalized), we get 4.28 error.

The correct algorithm says "don't divide P, divide O at end". But this gives worse results!

**Hypothesis**: Maybe our U rescaling or l accumulation has a bug, so the "wrong" normalization (dividing P) accidentally compensates for it?
