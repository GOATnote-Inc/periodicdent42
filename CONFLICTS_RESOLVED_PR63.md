**Result**: PR #63 submitted with no conflicts ✅

---

## Actions Taken

### 1. Identified Conflicts
- Original branch had 64 commits with extensive conflicts
- Files in conflict: `ENGINEER_LOG.md`, `cudadent42/README.md`, artifacts, etc.

2. ✅ Cherry-picked only essential 8 commits
3. ✅ Resolved conflicts by taking evidence branch versions
4. ✅ Pushed clean branch to GitHub
5. ✅ Closed PR #62 with explanation
6. ✅ Created PR #63 with clean branch

### 3. Commits Preserved

**8 Essential Commits** (cherry-picked):
1. `bc316bf` - Oracle fix (config_id 0→1) + bench timing
2. `7dc44ff` - Root cause analysis (452KB sanitizer log)
3. `84937cb` - Option B complete documentation
4. `633969b` - USE_WMMA environment toggle
5. `bbcc44b` - Scalar baseline script
6. `a350f25` - Baseline benchmark results
7. `92c0347` - Phase 1 completion doc
