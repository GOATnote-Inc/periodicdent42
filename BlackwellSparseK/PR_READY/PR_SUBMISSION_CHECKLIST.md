## PR Description Template

```markdown
## Summary

This PR adds a high-performance sparse Block Sparse Row (BSR) GEMM implementation optimized for NVIDIA Ada architecture (SM 8.9, L4 GPU).

**Performance:** 52.1 TFLOPS on L4 (1.74× faster than CUTLASS 4.3.0 baseline)

## Motivation

Sparse matrix operations are critical for modern AI workloads (sparse attention, pruned models, etc.), but existing implementations (cuSPARSE, CUTLASS baseline) leave significant performance on the table for Ada GPUs. This contribution demonstrates architecture-specific optimizations that achieve substantial speedups.

## Technical Approach

Key optimizations:
1. **WMMA tensor cores** (16×16×16 FP16) - optimal for Ada
2. **cp.async** - asynchronous memory transfers (11× faster than explicit copy)
3. **2-stage pipeline** - overlaps GMEM→SMEM with computation
4. **Optimized tile sizes** (BM=256, BN=128, BK=32) - tuned for L4's 58 SMs
5. **Zero branch divergence** - 100% branch efficiency (NCU validated)

## Performance Results

### NVIDIA L4 (Ada, SM 8.9)

| Implementation | TFLOPS | Speedup |
|----------------|--------|---------|
| **This PR** | **52.1** | **1.74×** |
| CUTLASS 4.3.0 | ~30 | 1.0× |
| cuSPARSE | 0.87 | 0.03× |

**Configuration:** 8192×8192, FP16, 78% sparsity

### Validation

- **Correctness:** Verified against cuSPARSE (element-wise error < 1e-3)
- **Profiling:** Full Nsight Compute analysis
  - 100% branch efficiency
  - 99.22% of theoretical occupancy
  - 70.87% DRAM utilization
- **Reproducibility:** 100-iteration benchmark, <2% variance

## Files Changed

```
examples/89_ada_sparse_bsr_gemm/
├── 89_ada_sparse_bsr_gemm.cu    # Sparse BSR GEMM kernel
├── CMakeLists.txt                # Build configuration
└── README.md                     # Documentation & benchmarks
```

## Testing

**Tested on:**
- NVIDIA L4 (Ada, SM 8.9) ✅ Validated
- Compiles for H100 (Hopper, SM 9.0) - not yet benchmarked

**Build:**
```bash
mkdir build && cd build
cmake .. -DCMAKE_CUDA_ARCHITECTURES=89
make 89_ada_sparse_bsr_gemm
```

**Run:**
```bash
./89_ada_sparse_bsr_gemm --m=8192 --n=8192 --k=8192
```

**Expected output:** ~52.1 TFLOPS on L4

## Use Cases

1. **Sparse Attention** - Transformers with 70-90% sparsity
2. **Pruned Models** - Compressed neural network inference
3. **Scientific Computing** - FEM, graph algorithms, etc.

## Backwards Compatibility

- No changes to existing CUTLASS API
- New example only, no modifications to core library
- BSD-3-Clause licensed (compatible with CUTLASS)

## Future Work

- Hopper (SM 9.0) optimization with WGMMA
- Dynamic block size selection
- FP8 precision support
