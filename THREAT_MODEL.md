# DHP Threat Model and Security Boundaries

## üéØ What This Framework Validates

### ‚úÖ Validated Threats

| Threat | Validation Method | Confidence |
|--------|------------------|------------|
| **Timing side-channels (software)** | 1000-run timing variance | High |
| **Branch-based leakage** | SASS disassembly + Nsight | Very High |
| **Memory addressing leakage** | Hardware counter comparison | High |
| **Non-deterministic execution** | Bitwise equality tests | Very High |
| **Memory safety issues** | Compute sanitizer (4 tools) | High |
| **Compiler non-determinism** | Dual-toolchain builds | Very High |

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Out of Scope (Not Validated)

| Threat | Why Not Validated | Mitigation |
|--------|-------------------|------------|
| **L2/DRAM timing variations** | Not captured by L1 counters | Needs specialized tooling |
| **Power analysis (SPA/DPA)** | Requires oscilloscope | External power analysis |
| **Electromagnetic emanations** | Needs EM probe | External EM testing |
| **Rowhammer-style attacks** | GPU DRAM not characterized | Future research needed |
| **Thermal throttling leakage** | Testing under controlled temp | Add thermal variation tests |
| **Micro-architectural state** | Spectre/Meltdown on GPU | Open research problem |

### üîí Security Assumptions

This framework assumes:

1. **Trusted Compiler**: nvcc/clang don't maliciously insert backdoors
2. **Trusted Hardware**: GPU microcode is not compromised
3. **Trusted Driver**: NVIDIA driver is benign
4. **Physical Security**: Attacker has no physical access to GPU
5. **Single-Tenant**: No malicious co-tenants on same GPU

**If these assumptions don't hold**, additional countermeasures needed.

## üéØ When to Use This Framework

### ‚úÖ Good Use Cases

- **Validating constant-time implementations** before deployment
- **CI/CD for cryptographic GPU kernels** (catch regressions)
- **Research on GPU-based crypto** (establish baseline security)
- **Teaching secure GPU programming** (best practices)

### ‚ùå Not Sufficient Alone For

- **FIPS 140-3 certification** (need additional documentation)
- **Common Criteria EAL4+** (need formal verification)
- **Production deployment** (need professional audit)
- **High-assurance systems** (need extensive threat modeling)

## üìã Pre-Deployment Checklist

Before deploying kernels validated with this framework:

- [ ] Professional security audit completed
- [ ] Threat model reviewed for your specific use case
- [ ] Physical security measures in place
- [ ] Monitoring and alerting configured
- [ ] Incident response plan documented
- [ ] Cryptographic algorithm choice reviewed
- [ ] Key management strategy validated
- [ ] Performance acceptable under load
- [ ] Tested on actual production hardware
- [ ] Disaster recovery plan in place

## üî¨ Future Work

Areas for framework expansion:

1. **Power analysis integration** - Interface with oscilloscopes
2. **EM testing support** - Automated EM probe data collection
3. **Cross-vendor validation** - AMD GPU support
4. **Formal verification** - Integration with Coq/Isabelle
5. **Microarchitectural state testing** - Spectre-like attacks
6. **Thermal variation testing** - Controlled temperature sweeps
7. **Multi-tenant testing** - Concurrent workload interference

**Remember**: This framework is one layer of defense. Defense-in-depth requires multiple overlapping security measures.
