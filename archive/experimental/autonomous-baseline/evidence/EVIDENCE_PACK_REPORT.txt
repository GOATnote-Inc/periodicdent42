ARTIFACT MANIFEST
=================

All files have been checksummed with SHA-256 for reproducibility verification.
See MANIFEST.json for complete file checksums.

REPRODUCIBILITY
===============

To verify:
1. Re-run all validation scripts with seed=42
2. Compute SHA-256 checksums of output files
3. Compare with checksums in MANIFEST.json

All validation scripts are deterministic with fixed seed.
