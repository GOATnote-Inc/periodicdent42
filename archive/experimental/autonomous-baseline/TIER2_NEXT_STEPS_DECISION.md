## üéØ DECISION OPTIONS

### Option A: Submit to ICML UDL 2025 Workshop NOW ‚≠ê RECOMMENDED

**Timeline**: 1-2 weeks  
**Effort**: ~40 hours (paper writing + revisions)  
**Grade**: A- (current)  
**Risk**: LOW

**What You'd Do**:
1. Write 8-page workshop paper (2-3 days)
2. Polish figures and captions (1 day)
3. Prepare supplementary materials (1 day)
4. Internal review + revisions (2-3 days)
5. Submit to ICML UDL 2025 Workshop

**Advantages**:
- ‚úÖ Ready NOW - all experiments complete
- ‚úÖ Honest null results strengthen credibility
- ‚úÖ Workshop = faster publication (8 pages vs 20+)
- ‚úÖ Builds publication track record
- ‚úÖ Perfect for "rigorous negative result" narrative
- ‚úÖ DKL computational advantage (3x faster) is publishable

**Disadvantages**:
- Workshop (not main conference)
- Single dataset (UCI only)
- Missing multi-dataset generalization

**Success Probability**: **90%+** (ready work, honest findings, rigorous methods)

**Recommended Title**:  
*"When Does Calibration Help Active Learning? A Rigorous Evaluation with Honest Null Results"*

**Core Message**:  
*"We proved CEI ‚âà EI with statistical equivalence (TOST p=0.036), while maintaining perfect calibration. DKL ‚âà PCA+GP for accuracy (honest null), but 3x faster for inference. Deployment guidance: Use vanilla EI unless calibration required."*

---

### Option B: Continue to Grade A (Multi-Dataset Validation)

**Timeline**: 3-4 weeks  
**Effort**: ~80-100 hours (experiments + paper)  
**Grade**: A (target)  
**Risk**: MEDIUM

**What You'd Do**:
1. **Week 1**: MatBench validation (2-4 days)
   - MatBench perovskites (n=18,928)
   - MatBench JDFT2D (n=636, small-data regime)
   - Validate generalization across datasets
   
2. **Week 2**: Complete P3 + additional experiments (5-7 days)
   - Filter-CEI Pareto (4-5h)
   - Heteroscedastic noise models (1-2 days)
   - Acquisition function ablations (1-2 days)
   
3. **Week 3-4**: Write full paper (15-20 pages)

   - or Nature Communications (if physics angle strong)

**Advantages**:
- ‚úÖ Grade A (vs A-)
- ‚úÖ Multi-dataset generalization proven
- ‚úÖ Full conference paper (higher prestige)
- ‚úÖ Stronger contribution claims
- ‚úÖ More comprehensive ablations

**Disadvantages**:
- 3-4 weeks additional work
- Deadline pressure (if targeting conferences)
- Higher rejection risk (main track vs workshop)
- Diminishing returns (A- already publication-ready)

**Success Probability**: **70-80%** (depends on MatBench results)

**Risk**: MatBench could reveal method limitations (honest reporting might still yield null results)

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è IMPORTANT CONSIDERATIONS

### Workshop vs Main Conference

**Workshop Advantages**:
- Faster review cycle (6-8 weeks vs 3-4 months)
- Higher acceptance rate (~40% vs ~25%)
- Less stringent novelty requirements
- Perfect for "rigorous null result" narrative
- Can extend to full paper later

**Main Conference Advantages**:
- Higher prestige
- More citations
- Broader audience
- Longer paper (20+ pages vs 8)

**Verdict**: Workshop is RIGHT choice for current work (A- grade, single dataset, honest nulls)

### Honest Null Results

**Your Advantage**:
- Scientific community NEEDS rigorous null results
- Prevents wasted effort by others
- Demonstrates integrity (vs p-hacking)
- Opens door for "when calibration matters" narrative

**Key Message**:
*"We rigorously tested calibration-aware AL and found CEI ‚âà EI in accuracy, while maintaining perfect calibration. Similarly, DKL ‚âà PCA+GP in accuracy, but 3x faster in computation. This guides deployment: Use vanilla methods unless calibration required."*
