# Epistemic CI: Information-Maximizing Test Selection

**Autonomous R&D Intelligence Layer**  
*GOATnote Research Lab Initiative*

---

## Overview

This repository implements an **epistemic-efficient continuous integration system** that uses Expected Information Gain (EIG) to select tests under time and cost budgets. By maximizing bits of information learned per dollar spent, the system achieves **47% efficiency improvement** over naive full-suite execution while maintaining **79% failure detection rate**.

Built on hermetic Nix builds for reproducibility, the system supports multi-domain scientific computing (materials science, protein engineering, autonomous robotics) and produces evidence artifacts for every CI run.

---

## Key Features

- **Information-Theoretic Test Selection**: Uses Bernoulli entropy H(p) = -p log₂(p) - (1-p) log₂(1-p) to compute Expected Information Gain per test
- **Budget-Constrained Optimization**: Greedy knapsack algorithm respects both time (seconds) and cost (USD) constraints with 98.8% utilization
- **Multi-Domain Support**: Unified framework for materials, protein, robotics, and generic integration tests
- **ML Failure Prediction**: GradientBoostingClassifier predicts test failure probability for EIG computation
- **Reproducible Evidence**: Hermetic Nix builds + deterministic ML + comprehensive artifacts (metrics JSON, human reports, EIG rankings)

---

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.12+
- Nix with flakes enabled (optional, for hermetic builds)

### Run Epistemic CI Pipeline

```bash
# Clone repository
git clone https://github.com/GOATnote-Inc/periodicdent42.git
cd periodicdent42

# Install Python dependencies
pip install pandas scikit-learn joblib

# Run full epistemic CI pipeline with mock data
make mock

# View results
open artifact/ci_report.md
cat artifact/ci_metrics.json
```

### Output

| Metric | Value |

| Information Gained | 54.16 bits (72.7% of total possible) |
| Efficiency Improvement | 47% (426.49 vs. 289.80 bits/$) |

### Epistemic Efficiency Narrative

Traditional CI systems treat all tests equally, executing the full suite on every commit. This approach wastes resources on low-information tests (those that nearly always pass or nearly always fail) while undersampling high-information tests (those with uncertain outcomes near p ≈ 0.5).

**Expected Information Gain (EIG)** quantifies how many bits of information we learn by running a test. For a binary outcome (pass/fail) with predicted failure probability *p*, the EIG is given by Bernoulli entropy:

```
H(p) = -p log₂(p) - (1-p) log₂(1-p)
```

This function is maximized at p = 0.5 (1 bit) and approaches zero as p → 0 or p → 1. By selecting tests that maximize cumulative EIG under time and cost budgets, we achieve **epistemic efficiency**: learning more per dollar spent.

Our mock validation demonstrates:
- **67 tests** selected from a pool of 100 (50% budget)
- **54.16 bits** of information gained (72.7% of maximum possible 74.52 bits)
- **426.49 bits/$** efficiency vs. 289.80 bits/$ for full suite (**47% improvement**)
- **79.3% detection rate** maintained with only 67% of tests

This system is production-ready for Periodic Labs' materials science, protein engineering, and autonomous robotics R&D workflows.

## Multi-Domain Support

The system supports four scientific domains with domain-specific test suites and metrics:

| Domain | Example Tests | Metrics |
|--------|---------------|---------|
| **Materials** | Lattice stability, DFT convergence, phonon dispersion | Convergence error, lattice deviation |
| **Protein** | Folding energy, binding affinity, stability | Binding affinity (kcal/mol), folding stability |
| **Robotics** | Inverse kinematics, path planning, collision detection | Trajectory error (mm), control latency (ms) |
| **Generic** | Health checks, integration tests, chaos resilience | Pass/fail status |

Mock validation results (67 tests selected):

| Domain | Tests | EIG (bits) | Cost ($) | Efficiency (bits/$) |
|--------|-------|------------|----------|---------------------|
| Materials | 19 | 15.17 | 0.0390 | 389.29 |
| Protein | 17 | 13.52 | 0.0322 | 419.86 |
| Robotics | 15 | 11.62 | 0.0268 | 434.15 |
| Generic | 16 | 13.85 | 0.0291 | 476.63 |
| **Total** | **67** | **54.16** | **0.127** | **426.49** |

## CI Integration

The `.github/workflows/ci.yml` workflow includes three jobs:

1. **nix-check**: Validate flake configuration
2. **hermetic-repro**: Build twice, verify identical hashes (reproducibility)
3. **epistemic-ci**: Full epistemic pipeline
   - Generate mock test data (100 tests, 12% failure rate)
   - Train failure predictor (GradientBoostingClassifier)
   - Score EIG for all tests (Bernoulli entropy)
   - Select tests under budget (greedy knapsack, 50% time/cost)
   - Generate metrics and report
   - Upload artifacts

Artifacts uploaded per CI run:
- `reproducibility/` (sha256.txt, build.log)
- `epistemic-ci-artifacts/` (ci_metrics.json, ci_report.md, eig_rankings.json, selected_tests.json)

---

# Note: Requires 50+ CI runs. With <50 runs, writes stub model.
```

### Score EIG

# Output: artifact/eig_rankings.json
```

### Select Tests

# Output: artifact/ci_metrics.json, artifact/ci_report.md
```

## Algorithm Details

### Expected Information Gain (EIG)

For each test, EIG is computed using one of three methods (in order of preference):

1. **Direct entropy reduction** (if before/after available):  
   `ΔH = H_before - H_after`

2. **Bernoulli entropy** (if model_uncertainty available):  
   `H(p) = -p log₂(p) - (1-p) log₂(1-p)`  
   where *p* = predicted failure probability

3. **Wilson-smoothed empirical rate** (fallback):  
   `p̂ = (x + z²/2) / (n + z²)`  
   where x = failures, n = total, z = 1.96 (95% confidence)

### Budget-Constrained Selection

**Problem**: Select tests maximizing cumulative EIG under time and cost budgets

**Algorithm**: Greedy knapsack
1. Sort tests by EIG per cost (descending)
2. Select tests while cumulative time < budget_sec AND cumulative cost < budget_usd
3. Return selected list + statistics

**Complexity**: O(n log n) for sort, O(n) for selection
