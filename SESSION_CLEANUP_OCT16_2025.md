# Session Cleanup - October 16, 2025

## Status: Repository Reset to Clean State

### What Happened

**Repo Organization**: ✅ **SUCCESS** - PR #64 merged
- Clean directory structure with `.cursor/rules/`
- 90+ MD files archived to `docs/archive/session_logs/`
- `CODEMAP.md` created as navigation guide
- `.cursorignore` and editor configs in place

**Flash-Attn Installation**: ❌ **FAILED**
- Multiple SSH connection interruptions
- Unable to verify installation status on GPU
- Complex heredoc commands kept failing
- Session became unmanageable

### What Got Cleaned Up

Repository cleaned to pristine main state:
```bash
git clean -fdx && git reset --hard origin/main
```

Removed:
- All `__pycache__/` directories
- All `.venv/` and virtual environments
- All build artifacts (`artifacts/`, `target/`, `out/`)
- All temp logs and debug scripts
- All evidence and profiling data

GPU instance stopped to save costs.

### Current Repository State

```
HEAD: a796468 - Repo Ops: Expert Organization Pass (2025-10-16)
Branch: main
Status: Clean working tree
GPU: cudadent42-l4-dev STOPPED
```

### What's Next

**Option 1: Use Pre-built Flash-Attn Wheels** (RECOMMENDED)
- Don't compile from source
- Use official wheels: `pip install flash-attn==2.5.8`
- If fails, download wheel directly from GitHub releases

**Option 2: Optimize Existing Kernels**
- `fa_s512_v3.cu` baseline: 38.00 μs (already 21% faster than PyTorch SDPA @ 48.13 μs)
- Apply EvoEngineer-Insight to existing working code
- Focus on incremental wins vs trying to install external deps

**Option 3: Document and Move On**
- fa_s512.cu is fundamentally broken (misaligned address)
- Flash-attn installation is too flaky via SSH
- Focus on production kernels that already work

### Lessons Learned

**What Worked:**
- Repo organization PR merged cleanly
- Git operations were solid
- Directory cleanup was effective

**What Failed:**
- Complex SSH heredocs with gcloud
- Flash-attn compilation over unstable connection
- Trying to debug 5 things at once

**Better Approach Next Time:**
1. Use simple one-liner checks, not scripts
2. Pre-download wheels, don't compile
3. Test locally before deploying to GPU
4. Document failures quickly, pivot fast

### Files to Review

- `V3_CLEAN_SLATE_ROADMAP.md` - L4-optimized kernel plan
- `CODEMAP.md` - Repository navigation guide
- `EVOENG_FA_S512_OPTIMIZATION.md` (archived) - EvoEngineer approach
- `ITER1_CRITICAL_FINDINGS.md` (archived) - fa_s512.cu failure analysis

### Immediate Action Required

**None.** Repository is clean and ready for next session.

When GPU work resumes:
1. Start GPU: `gcloud compute instances start cudadent42-l4-dev --zone=us-central1-a`
2. Use pre-built wheels or optimize existing kernels
3. Keep SSH commands simple (no heredocs, no TTY flags)

**Session End**: 2025-10-16 14:50 PDT  
**Duration**: ~4 hours  
**Outcome**: Repo organized (✅), Flash-attn failed (❌), Clean slate achieved (✅)
