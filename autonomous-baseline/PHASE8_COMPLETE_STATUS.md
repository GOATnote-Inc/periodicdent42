## Usage Examples

### Running CI Locally

```bash
# Install dependencies
pip install -e .[dev]

# Run all tests
pytest tests/ -v --cov=src --cov-report=term

# Run specific CI checks
pytest tests/ -v --cov=src --cov-fail-under=81  # Coverage gate
python -c "from src.guards import LeakageDetector; ..."  # Leakage check
```

### Generating Evidence Pack

```bash
# Via pipeline
from src.pipelines import TrainingPipeline
pipeline = TrainingPipeline(artifacts_dir="artifacts/experiment_001")
results = pipeline.run(data, model=model)

# Evidence pack created at artifacts/experiment_001/
# - train.csv, val.csv, test.csv
# - model.pkl, scaler.pkl
# - contracts.json
# - MANIFEST.json
```

### Applying GO/NO-GO Gate

```bash
from src.active_learning.loop import go_no_go_gate

decisions = go_no_go_gate(
    y_pred, y_std, y_lower, y_upper,
    threshold_min=77.0,  # LN2 temperature
)

# GO: decision == 1
# MAYBE: decision == 0
# NO-GO: decision == -1
```
