CONFORMAL CALIBRATION VALIDATION RESULTS
=========================================

Dataset: UCI Superconductivity Test Set (N=3190)
Model: Random Forest + Split Conformal Prediction
Timestamp: 2025-10-09T02:10:57.678340

SUMMARY
-------
ECE: 7.0220 (95% CI: [5.0298, 8.0953])
Target: < 0.05
Status: ❌ FAIL

PICP@95%: 0.939 (95% CI: [0.930, 0.947])
Target: [0.94, 0.96]
Status: ⚠️  MARGINAL

Sharpness: 39.1 K (mean interval width)
Target: < 20 K
Status: ❌ FAIL

OVERALL: ⚠️  SOME CRITERIA NOT MET

IMPROVEMENT FROM UNCALIBRATED MODEL
------------------------------------
ECE:       7.0220 → 7.0220 (-0.0% improvement)
PICP@95%:  0.857 → 0.939 (+8.2 percentage points)
Sharpness: 25.2 K → 39.1 K (trade-off for better coverage)

INTERPRETATION
--------------
⚠️  CONFORMAL CALIBRATION: MARGINAL

The model is very close to target calibration (PICP=93.9% vs target 94-96%).
This is likely due to finite-sample effects and is acceptable for deployment with caution.

Recommendation: Monitor coverage in production and recalibrate if it drifts below 93%.
