# Physics Justification for Tc Prediction Features

## Overview

This document maps **composition-derived features** to **BCS superconductivity theory** and **empirical observations** in materials science. All features used in the baseline models are grounded in physics intuition, ensuring interpretability and trust in autonomous lab deployment.

---

## BCS Theory Recap

The **Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer (BCS) theory** predicts the superconducting transition temperature as:

```
Tc ∝ ω_D · exp(-1 / (N(E_F) · V))
```

Where:
- **ω_D**: Debye frequency (phonon energy scale)
- **N(E_F)**: Electronic density of states at Fermi level
- **V**: Electron-phonon coupling strength

**Key Intuitions**:
1. ↑ Debye frequency → ↑ Tc (stiffer lattice)
2. ↑ Density of states → ↑ Tc (more carriers)
3. ↑ Electron-phonon coupling → ↑ Tc (stronger pairing)

Composition-only features cannot directly measure these quantities, but serve as **proxies** via correlations.

## Feature → Physics Mapping

### 1. Mean Atomic Mass (μ_M)

**Formula**:
```
μ_M = (1/n) Σ w_i · M_i
```
Where `w_i` is stoichiometric weight, `M_i` is atomic mass.

**BCS Connection**:
```
ω_D ∝ sqrt(k / M)
```
Heavier atoms → lower phonon frequencies → **lower Tc**.

**Expected Correlation**: **Negative** (μ_M ↑ → Tc ↓)

**Empirical Evidence**:
- Isotope effect: Heavier isotopes of same element have lower Tc
- Observed in Hg, Pb, Sn superconductors (α ≈ 0.5 in Tc ∝ M^-α)

**Validation**:
- SHAP importance: Should be in top 5 features
- PDP curve: Should show monotonic decrease or plateau

---

### 2. Mean Electronegativity (μ_EN)

**Formula**:
```
μ_EN = (1/n) Σ w_i · EN_i
```
Using Pauling scale.

**BCS Connection**:
Electronegativity affects:
1. **Bonding character** (ionic ↔ covalent ↔ metallic)
2. **Charge transfer** (doping level)
3. **Band structure** (N(E_F))

**Expected Correlation**: **Non-linear**
- Very low EN: Poor metallic character → low N(E_F) → low Tc
- Very high EN: Insulating → no superconductivity
- Optimal: ~2.0-2.5 (metallic with moderate charge transfer)

**Empirical Evidence**:
- Cuprates: Optimal doping at intermediate EN spread
- Iron-based: Requires metallic Fe with moderate EN neighbors

**Validation**:
- PDP curve: Should show peak in 2.0-2.5 range
- ICE curves: May show family-specific optima

---

### 3. Electronegativity Spread (σ_EN)

**Formula**:
```
σ_EN = sqrt( (1/n) Σ w_i · (EN_i - μ_EN)² )
```

**BCS Connection**:
Spread indicates:
1. **Charge transfer magnitude** (large ΔEN → ionic character)
2. **Band hybridization** (moderate spread → d-p mixing)
3. **Structural instability** (very large spread → competing phases)

**Expected Correlation**: **Non-linear (optimal mid-range)**
- Small spread: Uniform bonding, may lack pairing mechanism
- Moderate spread: Charge transfer + hybridization → enhanced V
- Large spread: Structural instability, phase separation → suppressed Tc

**Empirical Evidence**:
- YBa₂Cu₃O₇: Large EN spread (Y=1.2, Ba=0.9, Cu=1.9, O=3.4) → Tc=92 K
- MgB₂: Small EN spread (Mg=1.3, B=2.0) → Tc=39 K (still high due to light mass)

**Validation**:
- PDP curve: Inverted-U shape with peak at σ_EN ≈ 0.5-1.0
- SHAP: Should interact with mean EN (check SHAP interactions)

---

### 4. Mean Valence Electron Count (N_val)

**Formula**:
```
N_val = (1/n) Σ w_i · Z_val_i
```
Where `Z_val` is number of valence electrons.

**BCS Connection**:
```
N(E_F) ∝ N_val (approximately)
```
More valence electrons → more carriers at Fermi level → **higher Tc** (up to optimal doping).

**Expected Correlation**: **Positive (with saturation)**
- Low N_val: Insulator or poor metal → low Tc
- Optimal N_val: Maximum N(E_F) → maximum Tc
- Very high N_val: Band filling effects, reduced pairing → Tc decreases

**Empirical Evidence**:
- Cuprates: Optimal doping at x=0.15-0.20 holes per Cu
- Iron-based: Optimal at ~6 electrons per Fe

**Validation**:
- PDP curve: Increase up to ~4-6 valence electrons, then plateau or decrease
- SHAP: Should be top 3 features

---

### 5. Valence Electron Spread (σ_val)

**Formula**:
```
σ_val = sqrt( (1/n) Σ w_i · (Z_val_i - N_val)² )
```

**BCS Connection**:
Spread indicates:
1. **Orbital mixing** (e.g., s-d, p-d hybridization)
2. **Charge localization vs delocalization**

**Expected Correlation**: **Positive (moderate)**
- No spread: Single-element or uniform valence → limited orbital mixing
- Moderate spread: Hybridization → enhanced DOS at E_F → higher Tc

**Empirical Evidence**:
- High-Tc cuprates: Cu (d⁹) + O (p⁶) mixing critical for superconductivity
- MgB₂: B (p³) + Mg (s²) mixing

**Validation**:
- PDP curve: Monotonic increase or plateau at moderate values
- Interactions with N_val (SHAP)

---

### 6. Mean Ionic Radius (μ_r)

**Formula**:
```
μ_r = (1/n) Σ w_i · r_i
```
Using Shannon ionic radii.

**BCS Connection**:
Ionic radius affects:
1. **Lattice constant** (a ∝ r)
2. **Overlap integrals** (hopping t ∝ 1/a²)
3. **Band width** (W ∝ t)

**Expected Correlation**: **Non-linear**
- Very small r: Tight binding, narrow bands → low N(E_F) → low Tc
- Moderate r: Optimal overlap → high N(E_F) → high Tc
- Very large r: Weak overlap → low N(E_F) → low Tc

**Empirical Evidence**:
- Cuprates: La-Ba-Sr substitutions (radius tuning) critical for Tc optimization
- Iron-based: Rare-earth size affects Tc by ~10-20 K

**Validation**:
- PDP curve: Non-monotonic (peak at moderate r)
- Family-specific effects (ICE curves)

---

### 7. Ionic Radius Spread (σ_r)

**Formula**:
```
σ_r = sqrt( (1/n) Σ w_i · (r_i - μ_r)² )
```

**BCS Connection**:
Spread indicates:
1. **Lattice strain** (large spread → distortions)
2. **Structural instability** (competing phases)
3. **Anisotropic bonding**

**Expected Correlation**: **Family-dependent**
- Small spread: Uniform lattice → stable structure
- Moderate spread: Strain → enhanced V (some cases) → higher Tc
- Large spread: Instability → phase separation → lower Tc

**Empirical Evidence**:
- Cuprates: Moderate strain (e.g., Y vs La) enhances Tc
- Iron-based: Lattice tuning critical (pressure → Tc increase)

**Validation**:
- PDP curve: Non-monotonic, family-specific
- ICE curves should show heterogeneity across families

---

### 8. Density (ρ)

**Formula**:
```
ρ = (Σ M_i) / V
```
Estimated from composition + empirical structure data.

**BCS Connection**:
Density correlates with:
1. **Atomic packing** (coordination number)
2. **Bond strength** (overlap)
3. **Debye temperature** (ω_D ∝ sqrt(ρ) for fixed elements)

**Expected Correlation**: **Positive (weak)**
- Higher density → stronger bonds → higher ω_D → higher Tc

**Empirical Evidence**:
- High-Tc cuprates: ρ ≈ 6-7 g/cm³
- MgB₂: ρ ≈ 2.6 g/cm³ (light elements compensate)

**Validation**:
- PDP curve: Weak positive or flat (confounded by mass)
- Low SHAP importance (likely redundant with μ_M)

---

## Derived Features (Optional)

### 9. Mean Atomic Number (Z_mean)

**Proxy for**: Core electron shielding, relativistic effects

**Expected Correlation**: Weak (unless heavy elements present)

---

### 10. Covalent Radius / Electronegativity Ratio

**Proxy for**: Bonding character (metallic vs covalent)

**Expected Correlation**: Non-linear (optimal at intermediate ratios)

---

### 11. Melting Point Proxy

**Proxy for**: Bond strength, ω_D

**Expected Correlation**: Positive (but noisy)

---

## Feature Validation Protocol

For each feature:

1. **SHAP Importance**: Should rank in top 10 if physics-relevant
2. **PDP Curve**: Should match expected correlation (linear, non-linear, plateau)
3. **ICE Heterogeneity**: Family-specific effects indicate interaction
4. **Permutation Importance**: Drop in RMSE when feature shuffled
5. **Ablation Study**: Train model with/without feature → compare metrics

---

## Physics Sanity Checks

### Test 1: Isotope Effect

**Setup**: Create synthetic dataset with isotope substitution (e.g., H → D in hydrides)

**Expected**: Model should predict lower Tc for heavier isotope

**Pass Criterion**: ΔTc < 0 for 95% of cases

---

### Test 2: Electronegativity Spread Optimum

**Setup**: Plot PDP for σ_EN

**Expected**: Inverted-U shape with peak at 0.5-1.0

**Pass Criterion**: Peak within 0.3-1.2 range

---

### Test 3: Valence Electron Correlation

**Setup**: Compute Spearman correlation between N_val and Tc

**Expected**: ρ > 0.3 (positive correlation)

**Pass Criterion**: p-value < 0.05, ρ > 0.2

---

### Test 4: Family-Specific Effects

**Setup**: Fit separate models per chemical family

**Expected**: Feature importances vary across families (e.g., σ_r more important in cuprates than simple metals)

**Pass Criterion**: Top 5 features differ by ≥2 between families

---

## Limitations & Caveats

### 1. Correlation ≠ Causation

Features are **proxies**, not direct measurements. Interpretation requires domain expertise.

### 2. Non-BCS Superconductors

High-Tc cuprates and iron-based superconductors are **not BCS**. Features still correlate but mechanisms differ.

### 3. Missing Structure Information

Composition alone ignores:
- Crystal structure (e.g., layered vs 3D)
- Defects, grain boundaries
- Synthesis conditions (pressure, temperature)

### 4. Multicollinearity

Many features are correlated (e.g., μ_M and μ_r). Use regularization (Ridge, Lasso) or PCA if needed.
