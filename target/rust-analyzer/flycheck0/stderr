error: failed to select a version for `opentelemetry`.
    ... required by package `service v0.1.0 (/Users/kiteboard/periodicdent42/rust/service)`
versions that meet the requirements `^0.21` are: 0.21.0

package `service` depends on `opentelemetry` with feature `rt-tokio` but `opentelemetry` does not have that feature.
