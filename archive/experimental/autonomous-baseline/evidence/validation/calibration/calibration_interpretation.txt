SUMMARY
-------
ECE: 7.0220 (95% CI: [5.0298, 8.0953])
Target: < 0.05
Status: ❌ FAIL

PICP@95%: 0.857 (95% CI: [0.844, 0.868])
Target: [0.94, 0.96]
Status: ❌ FAIL

MCE: 0.0594
Target: < 0.10
Status: ✅ PASS

Sharpness: 0.0 K (mean interval width)
Target: < 20 K
Status: ✅ PASS

OVERALL: ❌ SOME CRITERIA NOT MET

INTERPRETATION
--------------
❌ ECE = 7.0220 ≥ 0.05: Model is miscalibrated. Predictions are either overconfident or underconfident. Recommendation: Apply temperature scaling or recalibrate conformal predictor.

❌ PICP@95% = 0.857 < 0.94: Prediction intervals are too narrow (overconfident). Recommendation: Increase conformal quantile or apply safety margin.

✅ Sharpness = 0.0 K < 20 K: Intervals are reasonably tight. Good balance between coverage and precision.

DEPLOYMENT RECOMMENDATION
-------------------------

⚠️  RECALIBRATION REQUIRED

Model requires recalibration before deployment. Recommendations:
1. Apply temperature scaling or Platt scaling to ECE
2. Adjust conformal prediction quantiles for PICP
3. Consider ensemble methods to improve sharpness

Re-run validation after recalibration.

Confidence level: LOW (recalibration needed)
