# âœ… Health Check Endpoint Fixed!

## Problem
The `/healthz` endpoint was returning a 404 error on Cloud Run, even though it worked locally.

## Root Cause
1. **Docker HEALTHCHECK Conflict**: The Dockerfile had a `HEALTHCHECK` directive that referenced `/healthz`, which conflicted with Cloud Run's native health checking.
2. **Reserved Path**: Cloud Run/Google's infrastructure intercepts requests to `/healthz` before they reach the application, causing a Google 404 page instead of reaching FastAPI.

## Solution
Changed the health check endpoint from `/healthz` to `/health`:
- âœ… Removed the Docker HEALTHCHECK directive
- âœ… Updated the primary health endpoint to `/health`
- âœ… Updated API documentation to reflect the change

## Working Endpoints

### âœ… Health Check
```bash
curl https://ard-backend-293837893611.us-central1.run.app/health
```

Response:
```json
{
    "status": "ok",
    "vertex_initialized": true,
    "project_id": "periodicdent42"
}
```

### âœ… Root Endpoint
```bash
curl https://ard-backend-293837893611.us-central1.run.app/
```

Response:
```json
{
    "service": "Autonomous R&D Intelligence Layer",
    "version": "0.1.0",
    "endpoints": {
        "health": "/health",
        "reasoning": "/api/reasoning/query",
        "docs": "/docs"
    }
}
```

### âœ… API Documentation
https://ard-backend-293837893611.us-central1.run.app/docs

## Files Changed
1. **`app/Dockerfile`** - Removed HEALTHCHECK directive
2. **`app/src/api/main.py`** - Changed endpoint from `/healthz` to `/health`

## Testing
```bash
# Health check endpoint
curl https://ard-backend-293837893611.us-central1.run.app/health

# Test reasoning endpoint (SSE streaming)
curl -N -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"query":"Test query","context":{}}' \
  https://ard-backend-293837893611.us-central1.run.app/api/reasoning/query
```

## Deployed
- **Revision**: ard-backend-00004-zgn
- **Status**: âœ… Live and fully functional
- **URL**: https://ard-backend-293837893611.us-central1.run.app
- **Fixed**: October 1, 2025, 2:45 AM
