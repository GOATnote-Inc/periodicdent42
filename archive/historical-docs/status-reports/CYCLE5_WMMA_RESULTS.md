# Cycle 5: Full WMMA Results

## Performance Summary

| Kernel | Latency (μs) | vs Baseline | Correct |
|--------|--------------|-------------|---------|
| Baseline (Cycle 2) | 1596.75 | 1.00× | ✅ 100% |
| Cycle 2a (Coalesced) | 1453.93 | 1.10× | ✅ 100% |
| Cycle 4 (Stage B FP16) | 1381.99 | 1.16× | ✅ 100% |
| **Cycle 5 (WMMA)** | **1274.43** | **1.25×** | ✅ **100%** |

**Overall Achievement**: **1.25× speedup** from baseline with **100% correctness**

---

## What Worked ✅

### 1. Full WMMA Implementation
- Successfully used `nvcuda::wmma` for Q@K^T computation
- 16×16×16 FP16 Tensor Core tiles
- Proper matrix layouts (row-major Q, col-major K^T)
- 4 warps compute WMMA, 8 warps do softmax

### 2. Correctness Maintained
- max_diff=0.000294 < 0.001 threshold
- Online softmax algorithm correct
- FP8 simulation working properly

### 3. Incremental Progress
- Cycle 2a → Cycle 4: +5% (FP16 arithmetic)
- Cycle 4 → Cycle 5: +8% (WMMA for Q@K^T)
- **Total**: +25% from baseline

## Why WMMA Didn't Show Expected Speedup

### Expert Estimate: 200-400 μs (3-7× faster)
### Reality: 1274 μs (1.08× faster than Stage B)

**Root Causes**:

### 1. Partial WMMA Coverage
```
Q@K^T: WMMA ✅ (32×64 @ 64×32 tiles)
Softmax: Scalar ❌ (not WMMA-able)
P@V: Scalar ❌ (32×32 @ 32×64, needs WMMA)
```

**Time Breakdown** (estimated):
- Q@K^T: ~20% (now WMMA-accelerated)
- Softmax: ~30% (still scalar)
- P@V: ~30% (still scalar - **BIG opportunity!**)
- Memory: ~20% (load/store overhead)

**Impact**: Only 20% of compute is WMMA-accelerated!

### 2. Small Tile Overhead
```
TILE_M=32, TILE_N=32, D=64
→ 4 WMMA tiles per Q@K^T (64÷16=4 in K dimension)
→ WMMA launch overhead significant for small tiles
```

### 3. Memory Still Bottleneck
```
SMEM: 32 KB (moderate occupancy)
Loads: sQ (once), sK/sV (16 tiles)
Traffic: 16 × (sK + sV) loads dominate
```

### 4. L4 Tensor Core Characteristics
- Ada architecture (sm_89)
- Tensor Cores optimized for **larger** matrices
- Small tiles (16×16×16) don't saturate hardware
- Better on A100/H100 with larger workloads

---

## Time Invested vs. Achievement

### Total Time: ~16 hours

**Hours 1-8**: Debugging to 100% correctness ✅
- Root cause analysis
- Fixed row coverage bug
- Fixed warp broadcast issue
- Restored correctness from 0% → 100%

**Hours 9-11**: Optimization attempts (Cycles 2a-4) ⚠️
- Coalesced loads: +5%
- FP16 arithmetic: +5%
- Total: +10%

**Hours 12-16**: Full WMMA (Cycle 5) ⚠️
- Tensor Core implementation
- Build issues resolved
- Gain: +8%

**Best Result**: 1274 μs (**1.25× faster** than baseline, 100% correct)

## Honest Assessment

### What We Achieved ✅
1. **Correctness**: 0% → 100% (major debugging achievement)
2. **Performance**: 1.25× faster (modest but real gains)
3. **CUDA Mastery**: SMEM, warps, WMMA, online softmax
4. **Systematic Approach**: TDD, incremental optimization
5. **Portfolio-worthy**: Full debugging + optimization journey

### What We Didn't Achieve ❌
1. **Target Performance**: 200-400 μs (expert estimate)
2. **Competitive with SDPA**: ~40 μs (PyTorch)
3. **Competitive with xFormers**: ~24 μs (production)

### Reality Check

**Current**: 1274 μs  
**SDPA**: 40 μs (32× faster)  
**xFormers**: 24 μs (53× faster)

**To reach 200 μs** (6.4× more speedup needed):
- Need WMMA for P@V (not just Q@K^T)
- Need cp.async double-buffering
- Need larger tiles (TILE_N=64)
- Need persistent CTAs
- Need L2 cache optimizations
- **Estimate**: 20-40 more hours

**To reach 40 μs** (32× more speedup):
- All of above + algorithmic innovations
- Likely need H100 (Hopper) with WGMMA+TMA
- FlashAttention-3 level engineering
- **Estimate**: Months of expert development

## Key Learnings

### 1. Tensor Cores Aren't Magic
- Need **large** matrices to saturate hardware
- Overhead significant for small tiles
- Must optimize **entire** pipeline, not just one step

### 2. Scalar Compute is Surprisingly Fast
- Modern GPUs have very fast FP32 ALUs
- Small improvements (5-10%) common
- Big gains need **transformative** changes

### 3. Production Libraries are Highly Optimized
- xFormers/FlashAttention: years of development
- Hardware-specific tuning (sm_80, sm_89, sm_90)
- Multiple kernel variants per shape
- Not easy to match with custom kernels

### 4. When Custom Kernels Make Sense
✅ Novel algorithms (not standard SDPA)
✅ Research prototyping
✅ Extreme optimization with months of time
❌ Matching production libraries
❌ Standard operations (GEMM, attention)

## Recommendation

### **STOP HERE** ✅

**Value Delivered**:
1. ✅ Full debugging journey (0% → 100% correctness)
2. ✅ CUDA performance engineering skills
3. ✅ Systematic optimization methodology
4. ✅ Realistic assessment of custom kernel development
5. ✅ Portfolio-ready case study

**Diminishing Returns**:
- 16 hours invested

**Next Steps** (if continuing, not recommended):
1. WMMA for P@V (4-6 hours, estimate +20% gain)
2. cp.async double-buffering (3-4 hours, +10-15%)
3. Persistent CTAs (4-6 hours, +10%)
4. L2 cache tuning (2-3 hours, +5%)

**Total**: 13-19 more hours for ~1.5× more speedup  
**Result**: Still 15-20× slower than production libraries
