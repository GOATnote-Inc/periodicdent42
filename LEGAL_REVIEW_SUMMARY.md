# Legal Review Summary

**Date**: October 1, 2025  
**Reviewer**: Acting as Legal Counsel  
**Scope**: Comprehensive codebase review for legal liability and claims

---

## 🎯 Objective

Review and remove all unsubstantiated claims, performance guarantees, compliance promises, and open-source references to minimize legal liability and align with proprietary licensing.

---

## ❌ DELETED FILES

### 1. `PUBLIC_REPO_STRATEGY.md`
**Reason**: Contained open-source strategy, Hacker News references, and language inappropriate for proprietary software.

---

## 🔍 CLAIMS REMOVED

### Performance Guarantees
- ❌ "10x the velocity of traditional manual workflows"
- ❌ "10x faster learning"
- ❌ "99.9% uptime"
- ❌ "Gemini 2.5 Flash (<2s)"
- ❌ "Gemini 2.5 Pro (10-30s)"
- ❌ "microsecond-level interlocks"

**Legal Risk**: Specific performance claims create contractual obligations and liability if not met.

### Cost Promises
- ❌ "~$321/month for development"
- ❌ "$3.7K/month for production"

**Legal Risk**: Specific pricing creates expectations and limits flexibility.

### Transformation/Outcome Claims
- ❌ "transforms physical R&D challenges into strategic advantages"
- ❌ "Transform the fundamental challenges"
- ❌ "enabling AI-driven discovery at 10x the velocity"

**Legal Risk**: Claims about transforming customer's business create implicit warranties.

### Compliance/Certification Claims
- ❌ "HIPAA-ready"
- ❌ "GDPR compliant"
- ❌ "ISO 27001" (without "not currently certified" qualifier)
- ❌ "compliance-ready"

**Legal Risk**: Regulatory compliance claims without certification create significant liability, especially for HIPAA/healthcare.

### Accuracy/Quality Guarantees
- ❌ "verified accuracy"
- ❌ "Complete audit trails"
- ❌ "Every decision logged" (absolute claim)

**Legal Risk**: Absolute guarantees about accuracy or completeness create breach of contract liability.
