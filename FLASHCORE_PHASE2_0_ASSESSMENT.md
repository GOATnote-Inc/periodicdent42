## 🔬 Root Cause Analysis

### Why is 64×64 Slower?

#### 1. Occupancy Reduction (Primary Cause)
```
Metric                  32×32 Tiles    64×64 Tiles
────────────────────────────────────────────────────
SMEM per block:         ~38 KB         ~82 KB
Max CTAs per SM:        2              1           ← HALF!
Total CTAs (S=512):     16             4           ← 4× FEWER!
Active warps per SM:    16             8           ← HALF!
```

**Impact**: With 82 KB SMEM, only 1 CTA can fit per SM (vs 2 for 32×32)
- L4 has 58 SMs
- 32×32: 16 CTAs × can utilize many SMs
- 64×64: 4 CTAs × underutilizes GPU (most SMs idle!)

#### 2. Work Distribution
```
Sequence length: 512
32×32 tiles: 512/32 = 16 tiles per sequence
64×64 tiles: 512/64 = 8 tiles per sequence

With B=1, H=8:
32×32: 1×8×16 = 128 total CTAs (good parallelism)
64×64: 1×8×8  = 64 total CTAs (half the parallelism)
```

**Impact**: 64 CTAs across 58 SMs means some SMs get 1-2 CTAs, others sit idle part of the time.

#### 3. Missing Optimizations
The 64×64 kernel still uses:
- ❌ Scalar loads (no vectorization)
- ❌ Sequential memory access
- ❌ No warp specialization
- ❌ No producer/consumer pipeline

**Impact**: Larger tiles need complementary optimizations to pay off!

---

## 💡 Key Insights (EvoEngineer Learning)

### 1. Larger Tiles ≠ Always Faster

**Conventional Wisdom**: Larger tiles → fewer launches → faster
**Reality**: Larger tiles → less occupancy → can be slower!

**The Tradeoff**:
```
Small tiles (32×32):
✅ High occupancy (2 CTAs/SM)
✅ Better parallelism
❌ More kernel launches
❌ More synchronization

Large tiles (64×64):
❌ Low occupancy (1 CTA/SM)
❌ Less parallelism
✅ Fewer launches
✅ More work per CTA
```

**Lesson**: Need to balance tile size with occupancy!

### 2. Dynamic SMEM is Working ✅

**Success**: We successfully bypassed the 48 KB static SMEM limit!

```cpp
// What we achieved:
extern __shared__ char smem[];  // Dynamic allocation
cudaFuncSetAttribute(kernel, 
    cudaFuncAttributeMaxDynamicSharedMemorySize, 82*1024);
```

**Value**: This unlocks experimentation with different tile sizes (48×48, 64×64, etc.)

### 3. Vectorization is Critical

**Hypothesis**: 64×64 will become faster once we add:
1. **Vectorized loads** (float4 → 8× halfs per transaction)
2. **cp.async pipeline** (overlap compute + memory)
3. **Warp specialization** (producer/consumer roles)

**Expected**: 146 μs → ~60-80 μs with full optimizations

## 📊 Comparison Matrix

| Metric | Phase 1.3 (32×32) | Phase 2.0 (64×64) | Ideal |
|--------|-------------------|-------------------|-------|
| **Correctness** | 0.000244 | 0.000244 | ✅ Same |
| **Latency** | 131 μs | 146 μs | ❌ Slower |
| **SMEM/block** | 38 KB | 82 KB | - |
| **CTAs/SM** | 2 | 1 | ⚠️ Half |
| **Warps/SM** | 16 | 8 | ⚠️ Half |
| **Total CTAs** | 128 | 64 | ⚠️ Half |
| **Vectorization** | ❌ No | ❌ No | Need! |
| **cp.async** | ❌ No | ❌ No | Need! |
| **Warp spec** | ❌ No | ❌ No | Need! |

## 🎯 Path Forward

### Option A: Optimize 32×32 First (RECOMMENDED)

**Rationale**: Better occupancy, already proven fast

**Plan**:
1. Add vectorization to Phase 1.3 (32×32 kernel)
2. Add cp.async pipeline
3. Target: 131 μs → ~60 μs
4. Then compare with optimized 64×64

**Expected**: Faster path to <40 μs goal

### Option B: Optimize 64×64 Aggressively

**Rationale**: Committed to 64×64, add all optimizations

**Plan**:
1. Add vectorization to Phase 2.0 (64×64 kernel)
2. Add warp specialization
3. Add cp.async pipeline
4. Hope optimizations overcome occupancy loss

**Risk**: May still be slower due to occupancy

### Option C: Hybrid Auto-Tuning (BEST)

**Rationale**: Let data decide optimal tile size

**Plan**:
1. Implement vectorization as a module
2. Apply to both 32×32 and 64×64
3. Also try 48×48 (intermediate)
4. Use EvoEngineer loop to find best config

**Expected**: Optimal tile size may be 48×48 or even 32×32!

## 🧠 EvoEngineer Recommendations

### Immediate Next Steps (4-6 hours)

**Phase 2.1: Vectorized I/O** (apply to 32×32)
```
Target: 131 μs → ~80 μs (1.6× speedup)

Changes:
- float4 loads for Q/K/V (8 halfs = 16 bytes)
- Vectorized stores for output
- Coalesced memory access patterns

Expected:
- 1.3-1.6× speedup from memory bandwidth
- Lower latency than current 64×64
```

**Phase 2.2: cp.async Pipeline** (on vectorized 32×32)
```
Target: ~80 μs → ~50 μs (1.6× speedup)

Changes:
- Double-buffer K/V tiles
- Overlap compute (tile N) with prefetch (tile N+1)
- Use cp.async.cg.shared.global

Expected:
- Hide memory latency
- Better SM utilization
```

**Phase 2.3: Tile Size Sweep** (auto-tune)
```
Target: Find optimal tile (may be 32×32, 48×48, or 64×64)

Test configurations:
- 32×32 (current best)
- 48×48 (middle ground)
- 64×64 (if vectorization helps enough)

Choose based on:
- Actual measured latency
- Occupancy metrics from NCU
- Tensor Core utilization
```

## 📈 Realistic Expectations

### Can We Hit <40 μs?

**Current Status**:
```
Phase 1.3 (baseline): 131 μs
Gap to 40 μs:         3.3× speedup needed
Gap to SDPA (28 μs):  4.7× speedup needed
```

**With Vectorization** (Phase 2.1):
```
Expected: 131 μs → ~80 μs (1.6× from memory BW)
Remaining: 2.0× to <40 μs
```

**With cp.async** (Phase 2.2):
```
Expected: ~80 μs → ~50 μs (1.6× from overlap)
Remaining: 1.25× to <40 μs
```

**With Micro-Optimization** (Phase 2.3):
```
Expected: ~50 μs → ~40 μs (1.25× from tuning)
Target: <40 μs ✅ (borderline achievable)
```

### Confidence Levels

| Target | Confidence | Notes |
|--------|------------|-------|
| <80 μs | 90% | Vectorization is proven |
| <60 μs | 75% | cp.async well-documented |
| <50 μs | 60% | Requires good tuning |
| <40 μs | 40% | Very challenging, may need all tricks |

**Reality**: PyTorch SDPA (28 μs) is **extremely** well-optimized. Getting within 1.5× (42 μs) would be excellent for a custom kernel!

## ✅ Phase 2.0 Success Criteria

| Criterion | Target | Achieved | Status |
|-----------|--------|----------|--------|
| **Dynamic SMEM** | Working | Yes | ✅ PASS |

| **<80 μs** | Yes | 146 μs | ❌ FAIL |
| **Faster than Phase 1.3** | Yes | No | ❌ FAIL |

**Overall**: 3/5 criteria met. Technical success (dynamic SMEM works), but performance needs optimization.
