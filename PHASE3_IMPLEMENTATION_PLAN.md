### Week 2: Driver Development

**Goal**: Write instrument control software

#### **XRD Driver** (if choosing XRD)
**Components**:
1. **Connection Layer**
   - Serial/USB communication
   - GPIB interface (older instruments)
   - Network socket (modern instruments)

2. **Command Layer**
   - Initialize instrument
   - Set parameters (voltage, current, start angle, end angle, step size)
   - Start/stop scan
   - Read data stream

3. **Safety Layer**
   - Shutter control (X-rays off when not scanning)
   - Interlock monitoring
   - Emergency stop
   - Beam status monitoring

4. **Data Layer**
   - Parse output files (.xy, .ras, .raw)
   - Convert to standard format (JSON + provenance)
   - Real-time plotting for monitoring

**Code Structure**:
```python
# src/experiment_os/drivers/xrd_real.py
import serial
import asyncio
from typing import Dict, Any
from ..data_schema import Measurement

class XRDDriver:
    def __init__(self, port: str, config: Dict[str, Any]):
        self.port = port
        self.config = config
        self.connection = None
        self.is_safe = True
    
    async def connect(self) -> bool:
        """Establish connection to XRD."""
        self.connection = serial.Serial(self.port, baudrate=9600)
        await self._check_safety_interlocks()
        return self.is_safe
    
    async def execute(self, protocol: Protocol) -> Measurement:
        """Run XRD scan autonomously."""
        # 1. Safety pre-check
        await self._check_safety_interlocks()
        
        # 2. Set parameters
        await self._set_scan_parameters(
            start_angle=protocol.parameters['start_angle'],
            end_angle=protocol.parameters['end_angle'],
            step_size=protocol.parameters['step_size']
        )
        
        # 3. Execute scan
        await self._start_scan()
        
        # 4. Monitor progress
        async for progress in self._monitor_scan():
            logger.info(f"Scan progress: {progress}%")
        
        # 5. Retrieve data
        data = await self._read_results()
        
        # 6. Parse and return
        return self._parse_to_measurement(data, protocol)
    
    async def _check_safety_interlocks(self):
        """Verify all safety systems OK."""
        status = await self._query_status()
        self.is_safe = (
            status['shutter_closed'] and
            status['door_closed'] and
            status['beam_current'] < 1.0  # mA
        )
        if not self.is_safe:
            raise SafetyViolation("XRD safety interlock failure")
```

**Testing Checklist**:
- [ ] Connection established
- [ ] Parameters set correctly

4. **Data**: ASCII output, easy parsing

**Advantages**:
- ⚡ Fast measurements (30 seconds - 5 minutes)
- ✅ Lower safety risk (no X-rays)
- ✅ Simpler calibration
- ✅ Cheaper ($15-30K used)

**Testing Checklist**:
- [ ] Baseline scan (blank)

### Week 3: Integration with Experiment OS

**Goal**: Connect driver to your autonomous planning system

**Integration Points**:
1. **Driver Registry**
   ```python
   # src/experiment_os/core.py
   from .drivers.xrd_real import XRDDriver
   
   # Register real hardware
   experiment_os.register_driver(
       "XRD_Real_Bruker_D2",
       XRDDriver(port="/dev/ttyUSB0", config=xrd_config)
   )
   ```

2. **Experiment Queue**
   - Real hardware experiments get priority
   - Timeout increased (15-60 min vs. 5 min for simulators)
   - Resource locking (only 1 experiment per instrument)

3. **Data Pipeline**
   ```python
   # Flow: GP → EIG → Protocol → Driver → Measurement → Update GP
   async def autonomous_loop(os: ExperimentOS, n_experiments: int):
       for i in range(n_experiments):
           # 1. AI selects next experiment
           protocol = eig_optimizer.suggest_next()
           
           # 2. Submit to queue
           experiment_id = await os.submit(protocol)
           
           # 3. Execute on real hardware
           result = await os.wait_for_completion(experiment_id)
           
           # 4. Update surrogate model
           eig_optimizer.update(protocol, result)
           
           # 5. Log decision
           logger.info(f"EIG={result.eig:.3f}, Best so far={gp.best_value:.3f}")
   ```

4. **Safety Integration**
   ```python
   # Before every experiment
   safety_check = safety_kernel.validate_protocol(protocol)
   if not safety_check.approved:
       logger.error(f"Safety violation: {safety_check.reason}")
       continue
   ```

**Testing Checklist**:
- [ ] Driver registered and discoverable
- [ ] Queue submits experiments correctly
- [ ] Safety checks pass before execution
- [ ] Data flows back to AI planner
- [ ] GP model updates with new data
- [ ] Next experiment selected based on EIG

#### **Safety Tests**:
1. **Emergency Stop**
   - [ ] Manual e-stop button works
   - [ ] Software e-stop command works
   - [ ] Dead-man switch triggers after 5 seconds

2. **Interlock Tests**
   - [ ] Door open → experiment aborts
   - [ ] Shutter fails → no X-rays
   - [ ] Overheating → shutdown

3. **Error Recovery**
   - [ ] Network disconnect → safe state
   - [ ] Power loss → safe state
   - [ ] Software crash → safe state

4. **Limits Enforcement**
   - [ ] Max voltage enforced
   - [ ] Max current enforced
   - [ ] Max temperature enforced

#### **Documentation**:
Create `docs/safety_validation_phase3.md`:
- [ ] Safety test results

- [ ] Training requirements

**Why This Matters**:
- ✅ Defense customers REQUIRE safety validation

- **Objective**: Maximize absorption at 500-600nm (UV-Vis)
- **Experiments**: 10 (autonomous selection via EIG)

**Why This Problem**:
- ✅ Relevant to satellite solar panels (market fit)
- ✅ Fast measurements (<5 min each on UV-Vis)
- ✅ Clear success metric (absorption peak)
- ✅ Publishable if results are good

#### **Execution Plan**:
```python
# scripts/phase3_campaign.py
import asyncio
from src.experiment_os.core import ExperimentOS
from src.reasoning.eig_optimizer import EIGOptimizer

async def run_campaign():
    # Initialize system
    os = ExperimentOS()
    os.register_driver("UVVis", UVVisDriver(config))
    
    # Initialize AI planner
    gp = GaussianProcessSurrogate(n_dims=2)
    eig_opt = EIGOptimizer(gp, cost_per_hour=1.0)
    
    # Seed with 3 random experiments
    for _ in range(3):
        protocol = generate_random_protocol()
        result = await os.submit_and_wait(protocol)
        gp.add_observation(protocol.parameters, result.value)
    
    # Autonomous loop (7 more experiments)
    for i in range(7):
        # AI selects next experiment
        next_protocol = eig_opt.suggest_next()
        logger.info(f"Experiment {i+4}: EIG={next_protocol.eig:.3f}")
        
        # Execute
        result = await os.submit_and_wait(next_protocol)
        
        # Update model
        gp.add_observation(next_protocol.parameters, result.value)
        
        # Log progress
        logger.info(f"Result: {result.value:.3f}, Best so far: {gp.best_value:.3f}")
    
    # Final report
    print_campaign_summary(gp, os)
```

**Metrics to Track**:
- [ ] Total experiments: 10
- [ ] Success rate: >90% (1 failure acceptable)
- [ ] Best value found
- [ ] Convergence rate (value vs. experiment number)
- [ ] EIG/hour efficiency

### Week 7-8: Analysis & Optimization

**Goal**: Prove 5-10x speedup vs. manual

#### **Benchmarking**:
1. **Manual Baseline**:
   - Hire grad student for 1 week
   - Have them run same 10 experiments manually
   - Measure time per experiment, setup time, etc.
   - Typical: 30 min/experiment + 15 min setup = 45 min avg
   - Total: 7.5 hours for 10 experiments

2. **Autonomous Performance**:
   - Your system: 5 min measurement + 30 sec setup = 5.5 min/experiment
   - Total: 55 minutes for 10 experiments
   - **Speedup**: 7.5 hours / 55 min = **8.2x faster** ✅

3. **Quality Comparison**:
   - [ ] Manual: n=1 per condition (no replicates)
   - [ ] Autonomous: n=3 per condition (automatic replicates)
   - [ ] Data quality: SNR, reproducibility
   - **Advantage**: Better data + faster = win-win

#### **Video Demo**:
Record 2-3 minute video showing:
- [ ] AI planner selecting next experiment
- [ ] Instrument executing autonomously
- [ ] Data appearing in real-time
- [ ] Model updating and suggesting next experiment
- [ ] Progress toward optimum

**Why This Matters**:
- ✅ Sales material for pilot programs
- ✅ Investor pitch deck content
- ✅ Conference presentations
- ✅ Customer proof of concept
