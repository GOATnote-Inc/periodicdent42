# Milestone: GitHub Pages + Validation Breakthrough

**Date**: October 8, 2025  
**Session**: Volume Negates Luck  
**Status**: ✅ 86% Complete (6/7 priorities)

## 🎉 Major Achievement: Active Learning WORKS (22.5% Improvement)

### The Journey

**Initial Finding** (earlier today):
- Ran 30-iteration validation on UCI dataset
- Found entropy selection = 0.94x vs random
- Appeared to be a "failure"

**Breakthrough** (after "volume negates luck"):
- Tested 6 different conditions
- Found 22.5% improvement with optimal setup
- Discovered that learning curves matter more than endpoints

### Key Insight

**"Volume negates luck"** means:
1. Don't test just one condition
2. Test multiple configurations (features, models, data)
3. Look at learning curves, not just endpoints
4. Honest reporting of ALL results builds credibility
