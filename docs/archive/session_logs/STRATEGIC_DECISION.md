## Decision Framework

### Question 1: **What is your primary goal right now?**

**A) Get first paying customer ASAP** ‚Üí **Option A or C**  
   - Defense/satellite need solutions NOW
   - Physical validation is table stakes
   - Pilot programs = revenue + reference customers

**B) Build defensible IP moat** ‚Üí **Option D (RL)** or **Option B (Simulators)**  
   - Publish papers, file patents
   - Differentiate on AI sophistication
   - Long-term strategy, not short-term revenue

**C) Balance both** ‚Üí **Option C (Hybrid)**  
   - Quick pilots with partner labs
   - Build IP on orchestration layer
   - Scalable model

---

- üü° Revenue in 12 months ‚Üí **Option A or B** (build then sell)
- üü¢ Revenue in 18+ months ‚Üí **Option D** (research-first)

---

## Recommended Path: **Option A + C Hybrid** üéØ

### **Phase 3a: "Pilot-Ready System" (Months 1-3)**

**Goal**: Demonstrate full autonomous loop with ONE physical instrument

**Deliverables**:
1. ‚úÖ Integrate 1 real instrument (XRD or UV-Vis)
   - Why: Easier than NMR, still impressive
   - Where: Partner university lab or rent time
   
2. ‚úÖ Run 10-experiment autonomous campaign
   - Virtual screen 100 candidates (Phase 1)
   - Physically test top 10 (Phase 3)
   - Close the loop: replan based on results
   
3. ‚úÖ Document everything
   - Video of autonomous operation
   - Data showing 5-10x speedup
   - Safety validation (critical for defense)

**Outcome**: **Pilot-ready demo** for first customer

---

### **Phase 3b: "First Pilot Program" (Months 3-6)**

**Goal**: Deploy system with design partner (defense prime or satellite co.)

**Deliverables**:
1. ‚úÖ Specific materials problem (e.g., "Find rad-hard alternative to X")
2. ‚úÖ 20-30 experiment autonomous campaign
3. ‚úÖ Report with validated materials + full provenance
4. ‚úÖ Case study for next customers

**Outcome**: **Reference customer + revenue** ($100K-500K pilot)

---

### **Phase 3c: "Scale Hardware" (Months 6-12)**

**Goal**: Add 2-3 more instrument types, handle parallel campaigns

**Deliverables**:
1. ‚úÖ Multi-instrument orchestration (XRD + NMR + UV-Vis)
2. ‚úÖ 3-5 pilot customers simultaneously
3. ‚úÖ Partnership with national lab (AFRL, NIST)

**Outcome**: **Product-market fit** at $1-2M ARR

---

## Why Not Phase 2 (RL Training) First?

**Market Reality Check**:
- Defense/satellite customers: "Show me results on real materials"
- NOT: "Show me your RL algorithm"

**RL Can Wait Because**:
1. Bayesian optimization (Phase 1) is already impressive
2. EIG-driven planning is explainable (trust moat)
3. RL shines for complex, multi-step reasoning
4. For single-loop optimization, GP + EIG is sufficient

**When to add RL**: After Phase 3, when you have:
- Real experimental data to train on (sim-to-real)
- Multi-objective problems (bandgap + stability + cost)
- Long-horizon planning (10+ step campaigns)

## Risk Mitigation

### Option A Risks (Hardware Integration)

| Risk | Mitigation |
|------|-----------|
| **Safety incidents** | Start with low-risk instruments (UV-Vis, not high-pressure reactors) |
| **Instrument reliability** | Partner with university lab that has maintenance staff |
| **Regulatory delays** | Focus on non-regulated materials initially |
| **Cost overruns** | Rent time on existing instruments before buying |

### Option C Risks (Hybrid with Partner Labs)

| Risk | Mitigation |
|------|-----------|
| **Partner reliability** | Contract with SLAs, backup labs |
| **IP disputes** | Clear agreements on data ownership |
| **Integration complexity** | Standardize on common file formats (CIF, JCAMP-DX) |
| **Quality control** | Require replicates, audit trails |
